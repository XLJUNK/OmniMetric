        "summary": "The 'Global Growth Meter'. This ratio divides the price of industrial copper by the price of safe-haven gold to determine if the market is 'Risk-On' or 'Risk-Off'.",
        "deep_dive": "The Copper/Gold ratio is the truest signal of global economic health. Copper thrives in growth; Gold thrives in fear. When the ratio is rising, the world is building, wired for growth, and optimistic. When the ratio is falling, investors are hiding in safety and expecting a recession. In 2026, this ratio is the anchor for the 'US 10-Year Yield'. Effectively, the bond market follows the Copper/Gold ratio. If the ratio rises while yields are low, it is a generational 'Buy' signal for yields. If the ratio crashes while yields are high, it is a signal that the bond market is about to have a massive rally as a recession hits.",
