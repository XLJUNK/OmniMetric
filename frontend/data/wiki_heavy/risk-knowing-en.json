        "summary": "The danger is not what you know; it's what you don't know. Once a risk is identified, you can hedge it, size for it, or avoid it. This maxim emphasizes the importance of 'Radical Transparency' about what can go wrong.",
        "deep_dive": "Markets generally price in known risks efficiently. If everyone knows interest rates might rise, the price already reflects that. The real crashes come from 'Unknown Unknowns' (Black Swans). The goal is to convert unknown risks into known risks through research.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Scenario Planning. We don't predict the future; we prepare for scenarios. 'What if China invades Taiwan?' 'What if the Eurozone collapses?' By modeling these known risks, we have a playbook ready. Panic comes from being unprepared.\", \"macro\": \"Forward Guidance. Central banks try to turn unknown risks into known risks by telegraphing their moves. A surprise rate hike crashes the market. A signaled rate hike is digested calmly. We listen to what they *say* they will do.\", \"quant\": \"Value at Risk (VaR). We quantify risk into a single number: 'We have a 5% chance of losing $1M in a day.' This doesn't stop the loss, but it makes the risk 'Known'. It allows us to set capital reserves appropriately.\", \"technical\": \"Defined Exits. A stop-loss makes the downside risk 'Known'. 'If I buy at $100 and stop at $90, my known risk is $10.' Without a stop, the risk is 'Unknown' (could go to zero). We never enter a trade without knowing the exit.\", \"policy\": \"Legal Audits. Companies do internal audits to find skeletons in the closet before the regulators do. If you find the compliance breach yourself, you can fix it. If the SEC finds it, you are fined. Know your own dirt.\", \"tech\": \"Penetration Testing. We pay white-hat hackers to attack our own systems. We want to find the vulnerability *before* the bad guys do. A known bug can be patched. An unknown bug is an exploit waiting to happen.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "illusion of Control. Just because you 'know' a risk doesn't mean you can control it. Knowing a tsunami is coming doesn't stop the wave. You can still get crushed by a known risk if your hedge fails.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Ignorance is not bliss in markets; it is negligence. Shine a light on every shadow in your portfolio."
