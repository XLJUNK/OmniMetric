        "summary": "This maxim advises traders not to try to buy the absolute bottom (the head) or sell the absolute top (the tail). These are the most dangerous parts of the trend. The goal is to capture the 'meat' of the move—the middle 60-80%—where the trend is clearest and risk is lowest.",
        "deep_dive": "Trying to pick tops and bottoms is an ego game, not a profit game. The 'Head' (bottom) is full of falling knives and false dawns. The 'Tail' (top) is full of euphoria and final blow-off tops. The prudent investor is happy to enter late (after confirmation) and exit early (into strength), leaving the risky extremes to the gamblers.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Regime Stability. In geopolitics, the beginning and end of regimes are chaotic and violent (heads and tails). The middle period of stability is where commerce thrives. We invest during the stable 'Pax', not during the revolution or the collapse.\", \"macro\": \"Trend Persistence. Macro trends (inflation, growth) persist for years. You don't need to predict the exact month inflation peaks. You just need to recognize the trend is down and position for disinflation. The middle of the curve is where the easy money is made.\", \"quant\": \"Momentum factor. Quantitative strategies purposely wait for the trend to start (giving up the head) before buying. We buy strength. We also sell before the trend completely reverses. Our models are effectively designed to capture the body of the distribution, ignoring the tails.\", \"technical\": \"Breakout vs. Reversal. Trading reversals (catching the head/tail) has a low win rate but high reward. Trading breakouts (catching the body) has a high win rate. We prefer high win rates. We wait for the 200-day Moving Average to turn. We give the first 10% to the bottom-fishers.\", \"policy\": \"Policy Lags. Policies are announced (Head) but take time to implement (Body). The market often overreacts to the announcement. We wait for the implementation details. The real economic impact happens in the middle innings of the policy rollout.\", \"tech\": \"Mainstream Adoption. We don't need to be the visionary who invests in the garage. Investing in Microsoft or Amazon *after* they were obvious winners (the body) still created generational wealth. We let the VCs take the risk of the 'Head' (startup failure).\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Premature Exit. The risk is leaving too much money on the table if a trend goes parabolic (e.g., a bubble). However, 'selling too soon' is a high-quality problem. The real risk is trying to squeeze the last 5% out of a trade and getting caught in the crash.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Greed makes you want it all. Wisdom makes you satisfied with the safe middle. Let someone else have the glory of the top tick; you take the profit."
