        "summary": "Nature's Code in Markets. Fibonacci Retracements use the Golden Ratio (1.618) to predict where a price correction will stop. It assumes markets move in waves, and these waves adhere to mathematical proportions found in nature, galaxies, and DNA.",
        "deep_dive": "Key levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%. The 61.8% level is the 'Golden Pocket'. It is the strongest support/resistance level. If price retraces more than 100%, the trend is invalidated.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Humans panic in predictable patterns. In a geopolitical crisis, the initial crash usually retraces 50% of the move before continuing down. This is 'Dead Cat Bounce' territory. We short the 50% retracement in war scenarios.\", \"macro\": \"Economic cycles do not follow Fibonacci, but traders do. We use it for entry points on secular themes. If Algorithmic Intelligence is a 10-year theme, we wait for a 38.2% pullback in Nvidia to enter. We don't chase; we let the math bring the price to us.\", \"quant\": \"Self-Fulfilling Prophecy. Because millions of traders watch the 61.8% level, orders pile up there. Our algos front-run this level. We buy at 62% and sell at 61.5% to capture the liquidity of the crowd.\", \"technical\": \"Confluence is key. A Fib level alone is weak. A Fib level + Moving Average + Support Zone = Iron Shield. We only trade Fibs when they align with other structural indicators.\", \"policy\": \"Central Banks defend levels that 'look' psychology important. The 50% retracement often aligns with psychological round numbers. The Fed implicitly defends these zones to maintain stability.\", \"tech\": \"Crypto is pure psychology, so Fibs work perfectly. In parabolic runs, Bitcoin respects the 38.2% level. In crashes, it respects the 78.6% level. We use Fib Extensions (1.618) to predict cycle tops where there is no price history.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Subjectivity. Drawing the lines requires picking a High and a Low. Different traders pick different points, leading to different levels. It is an art, not a science.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The market breathes in ratios. The Golden Pocket (61.8%) is where you find the best risk/reward."
