        "summary": "This maxim describes the structural difference between market peaks and troughs. Tops are often sharp, V-shaped events triggered by euphoria or a sudden shock. Bottoms, however, take time. They are 'processes' of accumulation where shares transfer from weak hands (capitulation) to strong hands (accumulation). You can't catch a falling knife; you have to wait for the knife to stop bouncing.",
        "deep_dive": "Psychologically, fear (bottom) is more paralyzing than greed (top). At the top, everyone rushes for the exit at once (panic selling) or rushes in at once (FOMO). At the bottom, investors are too scared to buy. The market must 'base' for months or years to burn off the fear and build a new foundation for the next bull run. This represents the 'Accumulation Phase' in Wyckoff theory.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Regime Change. The fall of a regime is often an 'event' (a coup, a revolution). But the rebuilding of a nation is a 'process'. You can overthrow a dictator in a day, but building a democracy takes a generation. Markets that crash due to geopolitical shock take years to recover.\", \"macro\": \"Deleveraging. A credit bubble burst (Top) is an event (Lehman Brothers). But the subsequent deleveraging (Bottom) is a painful, multi-year process of paying down debt. You cannot rush a balance sheet recession.\", \"quant\": \"Volatility Decay. At a top, volatility spikes. At a bottom, volatility must die. We look for the 'volatility squeeze'—a period of extremely low volatility that signals the selling pressure is exhausted. We don't buy the dip; we buy the silence.\", \"technical\": \"Basin Formations. We look for 'Saucer Bottoms' or 'Inverted Head and Shoulders'. These patterns take time to form. A 'V-bottom' is rare and dangerous. We prefer a 'U-bottom' where the price creates a floor (support) that is tested multiple times.\", \"policy\": \"Policy Lags. When the Fed cuts rates (Bottoming process), it takes 12-18 months to effect the economy. It is not a light switch. Investors who expect an immediate turnaround are often disappointed by the lag.\", \"tech\": \"Adoption S Curves. The 'hype cycle' peak is an event. The 'trough of disillusionment' is a process. But the eventual 'plateau of productivity' is where the real value is built. The Dot-com crash was an event; the build-out of the cloud was a process.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "V-Bottom Exception. The exception is the 'V-Bottom' caused by massive central bank intervention (e.g., March 2020). If the Fed prints infinite money, they can turn a 'process' into an 'event'. But relying on the Fed to save you is a dangerous strategy.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Don't try to catch the bottom. Let the bottom catch you."
