        "summary": "This maxim emphasizes that not being in a trade is a valid position. The 'opportunity cost' of cash is often lower than the 'actual cost' of a bad trade. Most money is made by sitting on your hands and waiting for the fat pitch, not by swinging at every ball.",
        "deep_dive": "Jesse Livermore, the legendary trader, said: 'It was never my thinking that made the big money for me. It was always my sitting.' The urge to trade constantly is a sign of an amateur. The professional waits for the setup that offers an asymmetric risk/reward profile.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Strategic Patience. In diplomacy, the side that can wait longer usually wins. Sanctions take time to bite. Negotiations take time to mature. Rushing into a geopolitical bet before the outcome is clear is gambling, not investing.\", \"macro\": \"Cycle Timing. Business cycles take 5-10 years. If you are trying to trade the 'mid-cycle slowdown' every week, you are blind to the big picture. Waiting for the 'credit cycle' to turn (e.g., when rates actually break something) is where the big macro trades are found.\", \"quant\": \"Signal-to-Noise Ratio. If you trade daily, you are trading 90% noise. If you trade monthly, the signal improves. If you trade yearly, you are trading fundamentals. Waiting increases your signal discernment and reducing transaction costs/slippage.\", \"technical\": \"Setup Confirmation. A breakout needs confirmation (retest). Waiting for the retest often means missing the absolute bottom, but it avoids the 'bull trap'. We pay for certainty with time. Waiting reduces the probability of a false signal.\", \"policy\": \"Legislative Clarity. Betting on a bill passing is risky. Waiting for it to pass and then buying the beneficiaries is safer. The uncertainty premium disappears once the law is signed. We wait for the ink to dry.\", \"tech\": \"Adoption S-Curve. Don't buy the prototype; buy the adoption. We wait for the technology to cross the chasm from 'early adopters' to 'early majority'. That's where the parabolic growth happens (e.g., buying Apple after the iPhone proved itself, not before).\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Opportunity Cost. The risk of waiting too long is missing the entire move (e.g., waiting for a dip that never comes in a strong bull market). Infinite waiting is just fear disguised as discipline. You must have a trigger to end the waiting.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Patience is a weapon. Use it to ambush the market, not to hide from it."
