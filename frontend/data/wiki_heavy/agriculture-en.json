        "deep_dive": "In 2026, Agriculture is the 'Final Frontier' of the inflation trade. Unlike tech or bonds, people cannot stop consuming calories. The index is defined by 'Climate Volatility' and 'Supply Chain Fragility'. As the world's breadbaskets face more extreme weather events, the 'Volatility of Food' is rising. For macro traders, Agriculture is the purest play on 'Global Population Growth' and 'Rising EM Incomes'—as nations get richer, they eat more protein, which requires more grain. It is a 'Non-Correlated' asset that often rallies when the rest of the market is in a recession. It is the most essential, but most overlooked, part of the transition to a high-density macro world.",
