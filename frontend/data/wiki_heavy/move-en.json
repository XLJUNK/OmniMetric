        "summary": "The MOVE (Merrill Option Volatility Estimate) Index tracks the implied volatility of US Treasury options. It is the 'VIX for Bonds' and measures the stability of the global cost of capital.",
        "deep_dive": "Bond volatility is the 'Gravity' of the financial system. In 2026, the MOVE Index has become more critical than the VIX because interest rate uncertainty dictates the valuation of all other risk assets. When the MOVE Index spikes above 120, it signals that the Treasury market—the world's deep liquidity pool—is becoming dysfunctional. High MOVE readings force banks to widen their bid-ask spreads and reduce leverage, leading to a 'Margin Call' on the global economy. In the current regime of fiscal dominance and high debt-to-GDP, the MOVE reflects the market's anxiety over sovereign debt auctions and central bank policy errors. A falling MOVE Index is a 'Green Light' for carry trades and equity multiple expansion, as it guarantees a stable interest rate environment for corporate business planning.",

            "geopolitics": "Reflects 'Global Reserve' stability. If major central banks (China/Japan) reduce Treasury holdings, the MOVE spikes due to supply/demand gaps.",
            "macro": "The primary indicator of the Fed's 'Transparency Gap'. If the market cannot predict the Fed's next move, bond volatility explodes.",
            "quant": "Fixed-income quants use MOVE to calculate the 'Risk-Free' rate premium. High MOVE leads to deleveraging in mortgage-backed securities (MBS).",
            "technical": "The 100-level is the psychological pivot. Staying below 100 allows for multi-asset risk-on; breaking 130 signals a systemic liquidity crisis.",
            "policy": "The Treasury's 'Buyback' programs are specifically designed to suppress MOVE spikes by providing a buyer of last resort for illiquid off-the-run bonds.",
            "tech": "Electronic market making in bonds has increased the frequency of mini-flash crashes in the MOVE, requiring advanced AI-driven execution for large bond blocks."

        "gms_conclusion": "Bond volatility is the master variable that governs all financial orbits."
