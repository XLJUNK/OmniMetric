        "deep_dive": "The 10Y-2Y spread is the roadmap for the business cycle. In 2026, the focus has shifted from the 'Inversion' to the 'Un-inversion'. Historically, the recession does not start when the curve inverts, but when it 'Un-inverts' because the Fed is rapidly cutting rates in response to a crisis. An inverted curve is 'Economic Poison' because it destroys the business model of banks: they borrow short and lend long. If it's inverted, they stop lending. This indicator is the definitive signal for the end of a growth regime. For macro traders, the first day of 'Bull Steepening' is the signal that the 'Hard Landing' has finally arrived.",
