        "summary": "The yield on the 10-Year US Treasury note is the bedrock of the global financial system. It serves as the 'Risk-Free Rate' against which all other assets—stocks, real estate, and corporate debt—are valued.",
        "deep_dive": "Changes in the 10Y yield affect mortgage rates, student loans, and corporate borrowing costs instantly. It is driven by three forces: 1) Fed Policy expectations, 2) Inflation expectations, and 3) The 'Term Premium' (extra compensation for holding long-term debt).",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Who is buying? China is selling. Japan is holding. The new 'Bond Vigilantes' are geopolitical rivals dumping treasuries to punish US fiscal irresponsibility. We track the 'Bid-to-Cover' ratio at auctions closely.\", \"macro\": \"The 'Neutral Rate' (r*) has risen. We are no longer in a 1-2% world. In an Algorithmic Intelligence-driven growth era, a 4.0% yield might actually be neutral. The danger is if it spiked above 5.0% rapidly, breaking housing and banking sectors.\", \"quant\": \"Correlations have flipped. In the past, stocks and bonds moved inversely (Risk Parity worked). Now, they move together. Rising yields = Falling stocks. This positive correlation makes hedging portfolio risk extremely difficult.\", \"technical\": \"We watch the '200-week Moving Average'. As long as we stay above it, the secular bond bull market of 1980-2020 is officially dead. We are in a structural bear market for bonds (rising yields).\", \"policy\": \"The Fed doesn't control the 10Y (they control the short end). But if the 10Y gets too high, they might try 'Operation Twist' or YCC to cap it. That would be the signal to go maximum long Crypto/Gold.\", \"tech\": \"Tokenized Treasuries (RWA) are bringing T-Bill yields on-chain. This creates a direct competitor to DeFi yields. Why take smart contract risk for 3% when Uncle Sam pays 4.5% risk-free?\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Risk of 'Fiscal Dominance'. If the US debt load becomes unmanageable, the market demands higher yields to hold it, which increases interest expense, which creates MORE debt. This 'Doom Loop' is the endgame scenario.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The most important chart in the world. Above 4.5% is a headwind for everything. Below 3.5% signals a recession. We want the 'Goldilocks' zone of 3.8-4.2%."
