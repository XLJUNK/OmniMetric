        "summary": "This maxim, popularized by George Soros, destroys the ego of the intellectual investor. The goal of investing is not to be a prophet; it is to be a profit-maker. You can be wrong 50% of the time and still be rich if your winners are 10x larger than your losers. It is about Expectancy, not Accuracy.",
        "deep_dive": "Think of trading like batting in baseball. You don't need a high batting average (accuracy) if you hit home runs (asymmetric payoffs). A trader with a 30% win rate can outperform a trader with a 90% win rate if the former cuts losses quickly and rides winners, while the latter takes small profits and holds huge losses.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Cost of Conflict. A leader might be 'right' that a war is justified (moral accuracy), but if the war bankrupts the nation (negative expectancy), they have failed. The 'how much you lose' part of the equation is often ignored by ideologues.\", \"macro\": \"Asymmetric Macro. George Soros broke the Bank of England not because he was 'sure' the Pound would crash, but because the risk/reward was skewed. If he was wrong, he lost a little interest. If he was right, he made billions. He bet big on positive expectancy.\", \"quant\": \"Expectancy Equation. Expectancy = (Win % * Average Win) - (Loss % * Average Loss). This is the only formula that matters. We optimize for Expectancy, not Win %. Often, increasing Win % actually decreases Expectancy because it requires taking profits too early.\", \"technical\": \"Risk/Reward Ratios. We never take a trade unless the potential reward is at least 3x the potential risk (stop loss). This means we can be wrong 70% of the time and still break even. We structure the trade so that 'being wrong' is cheap.\", \"policy\": \"Unintended Consequences. Policymakers obsess over 'being right' (passing the bill). They ignore 'how much you lose when you're wrong' (unintended economic damage). Good policy requires a cost-benefit analysis of failure, not just success.\", \"tech\": \"Venture Capital model. VC is the embodiment of this maxim. A VC firm expects 9 out of 10 startups to fail (wrong 90% of the time). But the one that succeeds is Google (1000x return). The magnitude of the win compensates for the frequency of the loss.\", \"gms_conclusion\": \"Ego wants to be right. The wallet wants to be rich. Choose one.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Blowout Risk. The risk of focusing only on Magnitude is that a single 'wrong' bet can wipe you out if you don't manage position size. You can't make up for a 100% loss. Survival is the prerequisite for positive expectancy.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Soros was right. Magnitude > Frequency."
