        "summary": "The 'Breakeven Rate' represents the market's expectation of average annual inflation over the next 10 years. It is derived by subtracting the real yield of TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) from the nominal yield of standard US Treasuries.",
        "deep_dive": "Unlike consumer surveys (which track past sentiment), the Breakeven Rate puts real money on the line. If the 10Y Nominal Yield is 4.0% and the 10Y TIPS Yield is 1.8%, the Breakeven Inflation Rate is 2.2%. This is the hurdle the Fed must clear to maintain credibility.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Deglobalization is structurally inflationary. As supply chains fracture and nations prioritize resilience over efficiency, the 'floor' for this rate moves from 1.5% to 2.5%.\", \"macro\": \"The Fed's target is 2.0%, but the fiscal reality suggests they will tolerate 3.0% to inflate away debt. The Breakeven rate sniffing out this 'Fiscal Dominance' is the canary in the coal mine.\", \"quant\": \"High correlation with Crude Oil and Copper wages. We use commodity futures term structures to front-run changes in Breakevens.\", \"technical\": \"The 2.50% level is the 'Credibility Line'. If Breakevens sustain above 2.50%, the market is betting the Fed has lost control. Below 2.00% signals deflationary recession risk.\", \"policy\": \"Powell hates unanchored expectations. If this metric rises while the economy slows, it forces the Fed to keep rates higher for longer (Stagflationary nightmare).\", \"tech\": \"AI is the massive deflationary counter-force. While energy costs rise (inflationary), knowledge work costs plummet (deflationary). The Breakeven rate is the battlefield between these two mega-forces.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The 'Wage-Price Spiral' risk. If Breakevens de-anchor to the upside, workers demand higher wages, locking in high inflation for a decade. The other tail risk is a 'Deflationary Bust' where debt overwhelm causes prices to collapse.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The market's lie detector test for the Fed. Currently pricing in a 'Soft Landing', but watch for a breakout above 2.4%."
