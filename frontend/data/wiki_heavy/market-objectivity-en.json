        "summary": "This maxim is the ultimate lesson in humility. The market is the final arbiter of price. If you think the market is irrational, you may be right in theory, but you will be broke in practice. You must align your trades with reality, not your opinion of reality.",
        "deep_dive": "Many smart people fail in markets because they are stubborn. They treat the market as an intellectual debate that they must win. But the market is not a debate; it is a force of nature. Fighting the tape because 'the fundamentals are wrong' is like fighting a hurricane because 'the weather forecast was wrong'.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Ideological Bias. Analysts often let their political views cloud their judgment. They bet against a regime they dislike, even if that regime is economically successful. The market doesn't care about your morals; it cares about stability and profit. We strip ideology from our analysis.\", \"macro\": \"Model Error. When our models say one thing and the market does another, we don't say 'the market is wrong.' We say 'our model is missing a variable.' The market price contains information that our model does not yet possess.\", \"quant\": \"Price Discovery. The price *is* the news. If a stock crashes on 'good news', the news wasn't actually good, or it was already priced in. We trust the price action more than the headlines.\", \"technical\": \"Trend Respect. The most dangerous words in trading are 'it has gone too high.' A trend can go much further than your logic dictates. We never short a parabolic move just because it looks 'irrational'. We wait for the breakdown.\", \"policy\": \"Fed Fights. 'Don't Fight the Fed' is a subset of this rule. If the Fed is pumping liquidity, asset prices will rise, even if the economy is terrible. Betting on the 'real economy' against the 'monetary reality' is a losing trade.\", \"tech\": \"Adoption Reality. Engineers often hate inferior technology that becomes the standard (e.g., VHS vs Beta). But the market chose VHS. Investing in the 'better' technology that no one uses is a way to lose money. We invest in what is used, not what is 'best'.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Herd Mentality. The exception is a true bubble. Sometimes the market *is* wrong in the long run (e.g., 1929, 2000). But can you stay solvent longer than the market can stay irrational? You must respect the *current* price while preparing for the eventual correction.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."
