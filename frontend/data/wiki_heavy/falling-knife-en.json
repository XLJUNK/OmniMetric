        "summary": "The Gambler's Fallacy. Just because an asset has dropped 50% doesn't mean it can't drop another 50%. Trying to buy a rapidly plummeting asset in hopes of a 'V-shaped' recovery is known as catching a falling knife. It usually results in severed fingers.",
        "deep_dive": "Mathematically, a 90% loss is a stock that fell 80%, and then halved again. Knife catchers confuse 'Cheap' (valuation) with 'Momentum' (price action). In a liquidity cascade, valuation is irrelevant. Forced sellers (margin calls) must sell at any price.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Regime change is aFalling Knife. When a government collapses or sanctions are imposed (e.g., Russia 2022), assets can go to zero. There is no 'floor' when property rights are suspended. We never catch knives in geopolitical crisis zones.\", \"macro\": \"Deflationary spirals are knives. When credit contracts, asset prices must fall to clear debt. This self-reinforcing cycle (Fisher's Debt Deflation) creates a vacuum of buyers. We wait for the Central Bank to step in (Floor) before buying.\", \"quant\": \"Mean Reversion vs. Momentum. We catch knives ONLY if the asset is 3 Standard Deviations below the mean (Bollinger lower band) AND volatility is contracting. If volatility is expanding, the knife is still accelerating. We use small position sizing for mean reversion trades.\", \"technical\": \"Wait for the bounce, buy the higher low. The safe entry is never the absolute bottom. It is the first 'Higher Low' after the crash. This confirms that buyers have stepped in and established a floor. We sacrifice the first 10% of upside for 90% higher probability.\", \"policy\": \"Bailouts stop knives. In 2008, bank stocks were falling knives until TARP was passed. In 2020, credit was a falling knife until the Fed bought corporate bonds. Policy intervention is the only thing that stops a systemic knife.\", \"tech\": \"LUNA was a falling knife. In crypto, a 'bug' or 'exploit' can drive an asset literally to zero in minutes. Unlike stocks, where a company has book value, a broken protocol has zero value. Never catch a knife in a code exploit.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The Dead Cat Bounce. A falling asset will often rally briefly due to short covering, luring in suckers, before rolling over to new lows. Distinguishing a bottom from a dead cat bounce requires volume analysis (volume should expand on the rise).",
        "gms_conclusion": "Let the knife hit the floor and stop vibrating. Then pick it up."
