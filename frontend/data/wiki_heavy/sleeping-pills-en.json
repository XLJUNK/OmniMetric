        "summary": "This maxim is about finding your personal risk tolerance. If you are losing sleep over your investments, you have too much risk. No amount of potential profit is worth your health or peace of mind. You should reduce your position size until you can sleep soundly at night.",
        "deep_dive": "Sleep is a leading indicator of stress. If you are checking markets at 3 AM, your subconscious is telling you that you are over-leveraged. The 'sleeping point' is unique to every investor. It is the equilibrium where your greed (desire for profit) is balanced by your fear (risk of loss).",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Strategic Anxiety. Nations that rely on a single choke point for their energy (e.g., Strait of Hormuz) do not sleep well. They constantly worry about blockades. Diversification of supply lines is the geopolitical equivalent of investing to the sleeping point.\", \"macro\": \"Liquidity Stress. Banks that rely on overnight funding markets (short-term debt) to fund long-term assets lose sleep when liquidity dries up (2008). Banks with a strong deposit base sleep well. We invest in companies with 'sleep-well' balance sheets (high cash, low debt).\", \"quant\": \"Variance Targeting. We adjust position sizes so that the dollar volatility of the portfolio remains constant. If volatility spikes (market gets scary), we automatically reduce size. This keeps the portfolio within our 'sleeping point' mathematically.\", \"technical\": \"Overnight Risk. The biggest risk is the gap opening. If you can't sleep because you are worried about what happens while the market is closed, you should not hold overnight positions. Day trading is the ultimate 'sleep well' strategy because you are flat every night.\", \"policy\": \"Regulatory Uncertainty. Companies that operate in legal gray areas (e.g., crypto, cannabis) have high regulatory risk. Investors in these sectors accept sleepless nights as the price of admission. We prefer regulatory clarity.\", \"tech\": \"Uptime. For tech companies, the 'sleeping point' is system reliability. If your engineers are getting paged at 3 AM every night, your system is fragile. You need to invest in infrastructure (reduce technical debt) until the pagers stop beeping.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Combustion. The risk is that you become so comfortable (sleep so well) that you become complacent. You stop monitoring your portfolio. 'Sleeping point' does not mean 'comatose'. You must still be vigilant, just not panic-stricken.",
        "gms_conclusion": "If you can't sleep, sell down to the sleeping point."
