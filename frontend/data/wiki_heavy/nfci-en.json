        "summary": "The Chicago Fed's NFCI provides a comprehensive weekly update on US financial conditions across money markets, debt markets, and the shadow banking system.",
        "deep_dive": "The NFCI aggregates 105 different indicators to determine if financial conditions are 'looser' or 'tighter' than historical norms. A negative reading indicates a loose, accommodative environment favoring growth and risk-taking. In 2026, the NFCI is the gold standard for tracking 'Shadow Banking' stress—the opaque area of the market where repo trades and private credit live. Because the NFCI captures data on leverage and risk appetite that traditional banking surveys miss, it is a leading indicator for industrial production and future GDP. A sharp upward move in the index (even if still negative) indicates that the 'Financial Plumbing' is clogging, which precedes stock market corrections by several weeks. It is divided into three sub-indices: Risk, Credit, and Leverage, each providing a specific diagnostic of where systemic pressure is building.",
