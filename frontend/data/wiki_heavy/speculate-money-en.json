        "summary": "This maxim is the cardinal rule of survival. Speculation is high-risk. If you trade with money you need for rent or bills, your emotional attachment to that money will force you to make bad decisions. You will panic at the bottom and sell. You must only speculate with 'risk capital'—money you are prepared to burn.",
        "deep_dive": "Emotional capital is as important as financial capital. When you trade with 'scared money,' your amygdala (fear center) hijacks your prefrontal cortex (rational decision making). You become physiologically incapable of following a plan. The only way to trade rationally is to trade size that does not threaten your lifestyle.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Sovereign Debt. Developing nations often 'speculate' by borrowing in foreign currencies (money they can't afford to lose) to fund infrastructure. When their currency crashes, they default. Prudent nations borrow in their own currency.\", \"macro\": \"Pension Funds. Pension funds should not speculate. They manage money people need for survival. When pension funds chase yield in private equity or crypto, they are violating this maxim. We short the tail risk of reckless pension funds.\", \"quant\": \"Kelly Criterion. The Kelly Criterion tells you optimal bet size. If you bet more than Kelly, you will eventually go bust, even if you have an edge. Trading 'money you can't afford to lose' is mathematically guaranteed to result in ruin (Gambler's Ruin).\", \"technical\": \"Stop Loss Placement. If your position size is so large that a logical stop loss would wipe out your account, you are trading too big. You must size your position *after* determining where the stop loss should be, not before.\", \"policy\": \"Bailouts. Systemically important banks speculate with money they can't afford to lose (depositor money) because they know the government will bail them out. This moral hazard encourages violation of this maxim.\", \"tech\": \"Runway. Startups often spend money they don't have on growth (speculation) before they have product-market fit. When the funding dries up, they die. Smart founders hoard cash to extend their runway.\", \"gms_conclusion\": \"Speculation is a luxury, not a necessity. Secure your base first.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Under-allocation. The risk is playing it so safe that you never grow your wealth. Inflation guarantees that 'money you can't afford to lose' *will* be lost if it just sits in cash. You must take risks, but they must be calculated risks with appropriate sizing.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Scared money never makes money."
