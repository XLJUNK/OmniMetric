A rising VVIX is the first sign that 'Tail Risk' is being priced in by institutional players. It often leads the VIX by 3-5 days. If the market is calm but the VVIX is spiking, it is a signal that 'Smart Money' is bracing for a crash. For macro traders, the VVIX is the ultimate 'Regime Indicator'—levels above 110 indicate a high probability of a 'Vol-mageddon' style liquidation event in the options market.",
