        "summary": "M2 measures the total money supply, including cash, checking deposits, and 'near money' like savings deposits and money market securities. It is the fuel tank of the economy and the long-term driver of inflation.",
        "deep_dive": "Friedman said 'Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.' M2 growth outpacing GDP growth leads to inflation. Conversely, M2 contraction (which happened in 2023-2024 for the first time in decades) is a powerful deflationary force.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"The USD's status as the global reserve currency allows the US to export inflation by expanding M2. However, BRICS nations are watching this debasement closely as a reason to de-dollarize settlement rails.\", \"macro\": \"We watch the 'Marshallian K' (M2 / GDP). When this ratio spikes, asset bubbles form. When it collapses, liquidity crises occur. Currently, M2 is stabilizing, but the 'velocity' of that money is picking up due to AI efficiencies.\", \"quant\": \"There is a famous 12-18 month lag between M2 peaks and CPI peaks. The massive M2 injection of 2020 caused the 2022 inflation. The 2023 contraction suggests disinflation will persist well into 2026.\", \"technical\": \"M2 doesn't have a trading chart, but its 'Year-over-Year Change' is a key overlay for the S&P 500. Stocks struggle to rally sustainably when M2 is contracting (negative liquidity impulse).\", \"policy\": \"The Fed controls M2 via QT (Quantitative Tightening). By letting bonds roll off their balance sheet, they effectively delete M2 from the system. It's the silent killer of speculative bubbles.\", \"tech\": \"Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) are the new 'Shadow M2'. They settle trillions in volume but aren't fully captured in traditional Fed M2 stats. We verify on-chain stablecoin velocity to get the 'True M2' picture.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The risk is a 'Liquidity Trap' where M2 expands, but money doesn't circulate (Velocity drops), leading to stagnant growth despite printing. Or, a 'policy error' where QT drains M2 too fast, crashing the repo market.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Money matters. If M2 is growing at 5-6%, stocks can rally. If M2 is negative, cash is king. Currently, we are seeing a 'Re-liquefication' phase begin."
