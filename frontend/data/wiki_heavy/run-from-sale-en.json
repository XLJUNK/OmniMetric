        "summary": "This maxim advises caution against unsolicited investment advice. If an investment is truly a great opportunity, the seller would keep it for themselves. If they are selling it to you, it means the 'price' (commission) is better than the 'value' of the investment.",
        "deep_dive": "Wall Street is a sales machine. It does not exist to make you rich; it exists to generate fees. Cold calls, hot tips from brokers, and 'exclusive' private equity deals are all red flags. The best investments are the ones you find yourself through independent research, not the ones that are pitched to you.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Lobbyists. When a foreign government or defense contractor tries to 'sell' us on the strategic importance of a region, we run. True national interests are self-evident. If they have to hire a PR firm to explain why we should care, it's because it's in their interest, not ours.\", \"macro\": \"IPO Hype. Investment banks 'sell' IPOs to the public at the peak of the hype cycle. They are selling because the founders want to cash out. We avoid IPOs where the 'sales pitch' is louder than the balance sheet.\", \"quant\": \"Algo Vendors. If someone is selling a 'black box' trading algorithm that guarantees 20% returns, it is a scam. If it really worked, they would not sell it; they would use it to become billionaires. We build our own algos.\", \"technical\": \"Pump and Dump. We monitor social media for orchestrated 'selling' campaigns. When thousands of bots start pushing a small-cap stock simultaneously, it is a trap. We fade the pump.\", \"policy\": \"Subsidies. When an industry lobbies hard for subsidies (selling the government on their importance), it is often because their business model is failing. A strong industry doesn't need a sales pitch to survive.\", \"tech\": \"Vendor Lock-in. Enterprise software companies 'sell' solutions that create dependency. They practically give away the software to get you hooked on the data ecosystem. We are wary of 'free' tech that costs your sovereignty.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Cynicism. The risk is becoming so cynical that you reject *all* advice. Sometimes a broker *does* have a good idea. The key is to distinguish between 'selling' (persuasion for their benefit) and 'advising' (analysis for your benefit). Check the incentives.",
