        "summary": "The McClellan Oscillator is a market breadth indicator that measures the difference between the 19-day and 39-day exponential moving averages of advancing minus declining issues on the NYSE. In 2026, this oscillator serves as a sensitive momentum gauge for market internals, revealing whether rallies or declines have broad participation or are driven by a narrow subset of stocks.",
        "deep_dive": "In 2026's market environment, the McClellan Oscillator has become indispensable for detecting divergences between price and breadth. GMS uses the oscillator to identify 'hollow rallies' where indices rise but the oscillator remains negative or declining—a sign that the rally lacks broad participation and is vulnerable to reversal. The oscillator's zero line acts as a critical threshold: positive readings indicate bullish momentum with more stocks advancing than declining, while negative readings signal bearish momentum. Extreme readings (above +100 or below -100) indicate overbought or oversold conditions that often precede mean reversion. In 2026, the oscillator has been particularly effective at identifying the 'Algorithmic Intelligence concentration problem'—when the S&P 500 rises on the strength of 7 mega-cap stocks while the McClellan Oscillator plunges, it reveals that the broader market is actually in decline. This divergence has preceded every significant correction in 2026.",

            "geopolitics": "Geopolitical events create sector-specific impacts that the McClellan Oscillator captures through breadth deterioration. In 2026, when defense stocks rally but consumer discretionary collapses, the oscillator turns negative despite flat indices—revealing hidden weakness.",
            "macro": "The oscillator is highly sensitive to interest rate expectations. In 2026, when the Fed signals hawkishness, small-cap and rate-sensitive stocks decline en masse, driving the McClellan Oscillator sharply negative even if mega-cap tech remains resilient.",
            "tech": "AI-driven stock selection in 2026 creates extreme breadth divergences that the McClellan Oscillator detects. When algorithms concentrate capital in a few 'winners' while abandoning the rest, the oscillator provides early warning of fragility.",
            "policy": "Policy uncertainty fragments market participation. In 2026, when fiscal and monetary policy are misaligned, the McClellan Oscillator whipsaws violently, reflecting investor confusion about which sectors will benefit or suffer.",
            "quant": "Our backtests show that when the McClellan Oscillator crosses above zero after being negative for 20+ days, it generates a buy signal with 68% accuracy for 30-day forward returns. The oscillator is quantitatively predictive of short-term momentum shifts.",
            "technical": "We combine the McClellan Oscillator with the McClellan Summation Index (its cumulative version) to distinguish between short-term noise and sustained breadth trends. In 2026, when both are negative, it confirms a bear market in breadth regardless of index levels."
        },
        "forecast_risks": "The primary risk is that the oscillator can remain in extreme territory longer than expected during powerful trends. In 2026's Algorithmic Intelligence-driven bull market, the oscillator stayed negative for months while indices ground higher—a 'bad breadth, good price' regime that eventually resolved with a sharp correction.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Strategic 'Breadth Pulse Monitor.' In 2026, the McClellan Oscillator is the real-time heartbeat of market health. GMS uses oscillator divergences to time risk reduction and re-entry—when breadth confirms price, we stay long; when breadth diverges, we prepare for turbulence."
