        "summary": "Warren Buffett's famous rules. Rule No.1: Never lose money. Rule No.2: Never forget Rule No.1. This is not about avoiding all losses (which is impossible) but about avoiding permanent capital destruction. A 50% loss requires a 100% gain just to get back to even.",
        "deep_dive": "The math of loss recovery is brutal. Down 10% = Need +11% to recover. Down 20% = Need +25%. Down 50% = Need +100%. Down 90% = Need +900%. Buffett's rule emphasizes capital preservation because compounding cannot work if the principal is destroyed.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Nation-state risk. Never lose money means never investing in a jurisdiction where property rights are not secure. If the government can seize your assets (Russia, Venezuela), the risk of permanent capital loss is 100%. We avoid these markets completely.\", \"macro\": \"Currency risk. Never lose money means protecting purchasing power. If you make 10% in stocks but the currency devalues by 20%, you have violated Rule No.1 in real terms. We hedge currency exposure to preserve real wealth.\", \"quant\": \"Drawdown control. We optimize for 'Ulcer Index' and Sharpe Ratio. We prefer a strategy with 10% returns and 5% drawdown over a strategy with 20% returns and 50% drawdown. The latter risks blowing up the account. Survival is the precondition for success.\", \"technical\": \"Capital preservation stops. We move stops to breakeven as soon as possible. Once a trade is 'risk-free', we have satisfied Rule No.1. We treat our capital like ammunition; if we run out of ammo, the war is over.\", \"policy\": \"Regulatory moats. Buffett buys companies with 'Moats' often protected by policy or regulation (Utilities, Railroads). These businesses have pricing power and are hard to kill. This minimizes the risk of total business failure (permanent loss).\", \"tech\": \"Platform durability. In Tech, Rule No.1 means avoiding unproven business models. We invest in platforms that have become utilities (Google, Amazon, Microsoft). Even if they stop growing, they won't go to zero. We avoid the 'Feature not a Company' risks.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Risk Aversion Paralysis. Taking Rule No.1 too literally leads to holding only cash (which loses value to inflation). You must take calculated risks. 'Never lose money' means 'Never take a risk that can wipe you out'.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Protect the downside, and the upside will take care of itself. Compounding works miracles, but only if you don't interrupt it with a zero."
