        "summary": "This maxim states that when the majority of market participants agree on a direction, the market usually moves in the opposite direction. The 'crowd' is right in the middle of a trend but consistently wrong at significant turning points (tops and bottoms).",
        "deep_dive": "This is a function of liquidity. If everyone is bullish, they have already bought. There is no one left to buy. If there are no buyers left, the price can only go down. Conversely, if everyone is bearish, they have already sold. The market turns when the last bull becomes a bear.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Consensus Bias. When every geopolitical analyst agrees that a war is 'inevitable', it often doesn't happen (deterrence works). When everyone agrees peace is here to stay, war breaks out. We look for 'Black Swans' that the consensus ignores.\", \"macro\": \"Forecast Clustering. Economists herd. If the consensus forecast is for 2% growth, the actual result is rarely 2%. It's either -1% or 5%. We bet against the consensus forecast because the crowd minimizes variance.\", \"quant\": \"Sentiment Data. We scrape Twitter, Reddit, and news. When sentiment reaches extreme levels (e.g., 90% bullish), we short. When it reaches 90% bearish, we buy. The 'Crowd' is our counter-indicator.\", \"technical\": \"Overcrowded Trades. When a trade becomes too popular (e.g., 'Long Tech'), the positioning becomes lopsided. A small spark can cause a massive unwind. We measure 'crowdedness' via RSI, open interest, and fund positioning.\", \"policy\": \"Popular Mandates. Policies that are overwhelmingly popular (e.g., rent control, tariffs) often have disastrous economic side effects. The 'political crowd' demands quick fixes that break the system long-term.\", \"tech\": \"Hype Cycles. The crowd chases the 'Current Thing' (AI, Crypto, Dotcom). They buy at the peak of inflated expectations. We wait for the 'Trough of Disillusionment' when the crowd has given up, but the technology is actually maturing.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Trend Fighting. The crowd can be right for a long time during a strong trend. Betting against the crowd *too early* is suicide (as seen in the Dotcom bubble). You must wait for the crowd to reach an *extreme*.",
        "gms_conclusion": "To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are greedily buying requires the greatest fortitude and pays the greatest reward."
