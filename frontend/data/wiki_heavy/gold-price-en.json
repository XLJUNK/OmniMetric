        "summary": "Gold is not a commodity; it is a currency. It is the only financial asset that is not someone else's liability. It measures the quality of fiat currencies, and lately, the quality is poor.",
        "deep_dive": "Historically, Gold traded inversely to Real Interest Rates (when rates rose, gold fell). This correlation broke in 2022. Gold rose WITH rates. This signals a regime change: central banks are buying Gold not for returns, but for sovereignty and sanction-proofing.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"The freezing of Russia's reserves taught every central bank a lesson: If your reserves are in dollars, they can be confiscated. China, India, and Poland are buying gold record pace to 'De-Risk' from the US geopolitical hegemony.\", \"macro\": \"Gold is sniffing out 'Fiscal Dominance'. It knows the Fed will eventually have to monetize the debt. It is front-running the inevitable return of Quantitative Easing (QE).\", \"quant\": \"We model Gold as a zero-coupon perpetual bond with an infinite duration. In a portfolio, it is the ultimate non-correlated asset to tech stocks. It reduces drawdown volatility significantly.\", \"technical\": \"The $2700 level is the new floor. We are in a 'Cup and Handle' formation that spans 10 years on the monthly chart. The measured move target is $4000+. Every dip is a gift.\", \"policy\": \"Basel III reforms reclassified allocated Gold as a 'Tier 1' risk-free asset for banks (previously Tier 3). This incentivizes commercial banks to hold physical gold on their balance sheets.\", \"tech\": \"Bitcoin is 'Digital Gold', but it hasn't replaced the shiny rock. They are siblings. Boomers buy Gold; Zoomers buy Bitcoin. Both are bets against the central bank printing press.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "A liquidity crisis where everything is sold to raise cash (like March 2020). Gold can drop 10-15% in a week during a panic, but it is usually the first to recover.",
        "gms_conclusion": "This is no longer a trade; it is a required holding. The 'Anti-Fiat' trade is the defining theme of the decade."
