        "summary": "This maxim, attributed to Benjamin Franklin, emphasizes that your edge in the market comes from what you know that others don't. In a world of infinite information, synthesis is power. The return on investment (ROI) for learning a new skill or understanding a new market is higher than any stock you can buy.",
        "deep_dive": "Alpha (excess return) is a function of information asymmetry. If you know how to read a balance sheet and your opponent doesn't, you win. If you understand the geopolitics of lithium and they don't, you win. The most sustainable edge is a cognitive edge.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Cultural Intelligence. Understanding the culture and history of a nation is an investment. Analysts who knew Russian history knew Putin would invade Ukraine. Those who only looked at economic charts missed it. Cultural knowledge pays geopolitical interest.\", \"macro\": \"Economic History. 'History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.' Studying past inflations (Weimar, 1970s) gives you the playbook for today. Ignorance of history guarantees you will be blindsided by the 'unprecedented' event that has actually happened ten times before.\", \"quant\": \"Skill Acquisition. Learning Python or Machine Learning is an investment with infinite ROI. It allows you to automate your analysis and see patterns others miss. The best quant trade is investing in your own coding ability.\", \"technical\": \"Pattern Recognition. You can't trade a Head and Shoulders pattern if you don't know what it looks like. Screen time (studying charts) builds the neural pathways for instant pattern recognition. This is 'muscle memory' for the brain.\", \"policy\": \"Legal Literacy. Understanding the tax code or regulatory framework can save you millions. The rich invest heavily in legal knowledge (lawyers). The poor pay the price of ignorance.\", \"tech\": \"Technical Literacy. In the 21st century, not understanding how the internet works is like not being able to read. Investing in understanding blockchain, Algorithmic Intelligence, or cybersecurity is mandatory for survival.\", \"gms_conclusion\": \"Your brain is your primary asset. Compound its value daily.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Analysis Paralysis. The risk is 'over-learning' without acting. You can read every book on swimming, but eventually, you have to get in the pool. Knowledge is potential power; execution is actual power.",
