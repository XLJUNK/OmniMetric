        "deep_dive": "In 2026, Natural Gas is no longer a localized commodity; it is a 'Globalized Fuel' via LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas). Prices at Henry Hub now move in response to events in Europe and Asia. Gas is the essential backstop for wind and solar power—when the sun isn't shining, gas must burn. This makes it a hyper-seasonal and hyper-volatile asset. For macro traders, Natural Gas is the 'Widowmaker' due to its extreme price swings. In a world of 'Net Zero' targets, gas is the only fuel that satisfies both the need for reliability and the desire for lower emissions. It is the primary input for the world's fertilizer supply, making it a critical driver of global food security.",
