        "summary": "The Golden Rule of Trading. It is mathematically impossible to be profitable if your losses are larger than your wins, unless your win rate is exceptionally high. Most successful traders have a win rate of only 40-50%, but they make money because their average win is 3x their average loss.",
        "deep_dive": "This maxim addresses the 'Disposition Effect', a cognitive bias where investors sell winners too early (to lock in a gain) and hold losers too long (hoping to get back to even). Successful investing requires inverting this natural human instinct.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Sunk Cost Fallacy. Governments often fight losing wars for years because they 'have already spent so much blood and treasure'. Smart empires cut their losses (withdraw) to preserve resources for battles they can win. Investors must do the same.\", \"macro\": \"Regime Shifts. When the macro environment changes (e.g., from Deflation to Inflation), old winners become new losers. Holding onto 'Deflation Assets' (like long duration bonds) during an 'Inflation Regime' is disastrous. Cut losses immediately when the regime shifts.\", \"quant\": \"Expectancy Theory. (Probability of Win * Avg Win) - (Probability of Loss * Avg Loss) = Expectancy. If you cap your losses at 1R (Risk Unit) and let your winners run to 3R or 5R, you can be wrong 70% of the time and still break even. Cutting losses is about protecting the 'Avg Loss' variable.\", \"technical\": \"Stop Losses. We use technical levels (Support/Resistance) to define our invalidation point. If price closes below support, the trade is invalid. We exit. We do not 'hope'. Hope is not a strategy. The chart tells us when we are wrong.\", \"policy\": \"Policy errors are rarely admitted quickly. Central banks will insist inflation is 'transitory' long after it isn't. Investors cannot afford to wait for the official apology. When the policy is clearly wrong (losing credibility), the market punishes it. Cut exposure to policy errors.\", \"tech\": \"fail fast. In Silicon Valley, 'Fail Fast' is a virtue. If a product isn't working, kill it and pivot. Holding onto a dying legacy technology (like Kodak or Blockbuster) leads to bankruptcy. Cut the legacy, fund the innovation.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Whipsaws. The risk of cutting losses too tight is getting stopped out right before the market turns. This is 'Death by a Thousand Cuts'. You must give the trade enough room to breathe (Volatility Adjusted Stops).",
        "gms_conclusion": "Your first loss is your best loss. Taking a small loss is painful, but taking a catastrophic loss is fatal. Survive to trade another day."
