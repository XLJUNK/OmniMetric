        "deep_dive": "In 2026, the world is in a 'Re-armament' cycle not seen since the Cold War. As geopolitical tensions rise in Eurasia and the Pacific, nations are increasing their defense spending from 2% to 3% or even 4% of GDP. This creates 'Multi-decade Visibility' for defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Rheinmetall, and BAE Systems. These firms are effectively 'States within States', with guaranteed order books that span 10-20 years. Additionally, the civil aviation recovery post-2024 has provided a secondary growth engine for firms that build engines and airframes. For macro traders, Defense is the ultimate 'Hedge against Chaos'. When geopolitics get worse, Defense stocks get better.",
