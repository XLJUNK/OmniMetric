        "summary": "This Wall Street classic reminds traders that you can profit from a rising market (Bull) or a falling market (Bear), but you cannot profit if you are greedy (Pig). 'Pigs' are slaughtered because they stay in the trade too long, hoping for every last cent, and get caught in the reversal.",
        "deep_dive": "The market tolerates directional bets, but it punishes excess. The 'Pig' is defined by a lack of a clear exit strategy. They let winning trades turn into losing trades because they refuse to take profit. They double down on losing trades because they refuse to take a loss.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Imperial Overreach. Nations that expand too fast (Pigs) often collapse (Napoleon, Hitler). They do not know when to consolidate their gains. Smart powers (Bulls/Bears) know their limits and secure their borders before expanding further.\", \"macro\": \"Bubble Economics. During a bubble, everyone becomes a Pig. They leverage up to buy assets at insane valuations, believing the price will go up forever. When the bubble bursts, the Pigs are slaughtered (bankruptcy). The prudent investors (Bulls/Bears) sold early.\", \"quant\": \"Mean Reversion Strategies. We explicitly trade against Pigs. When price deviates significantly from the mean (the Pig is chasing), we bet on reversion. We provide liquidity to the Pigs at the worst possible price for them.\", \"technical\": \"Trailing Stops. The antidote to being a Pig is a trailing stop loss. It allows you to ride the trend (Bull/Bear) but forces you out when the trend reverses, preventing you from holding on for too long (Pig).\", \"policy\": \"Fiscal Obese. Governments that spend without limit (Pigs) eventually face a debt crisis (Slaughter). Prudent fiscal policy (Bull/Bear) manages debt sustainability. We short the bonds of 'Pig' nations.\", \"tech\": \"Feature Creep. Startups that try to do everything (Pigs) often fail. They lose focus. Companies that focus on doing one thing extremely well (Bull/Bear) tend to succeed and then expand slowly.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Selling Too Early. The risk of trying *not* to be a Pig is that you become a Chicken. You sell too early and miss the big move. You must find the balance between greed (holding too long) and fear (selling too soon).",
        "gms_conclusion": "No one ever went broke taking a profit."
