        "summary": "This mental model, popularized by Warren Buffett, states that you do not need to be an expert on everything. You only need to be able to evaluate companies within your 'circle of competence'. The size of the circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital. Straying outside your circle leads to critical errors.",
        "deep_dive": "Tom Watson Sr., founder of IBM, said: 'I'm no genius. I'm smart in spots, and I stay around those spots.' That is the essence of the circle of competence. If you understand pharmaceuticals but not crypto, buy pharmaceuticals and ignore crypto. You don't get extra points for difficulty in investing.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Regional Expertise. We listen to analysts who have deep, localized knowledge (a 'circle of competence') in a specific region. A generalist 'global' analyst is often useless. We want the guy who knows the specific political factions in Thailand, not the guy who reads the NYT headlines about Asia.\", \"macro\": \"Knowing What You Don't Know. The most dangerous macroeconomists are those who think they can predict everything (inflation, GDP, wars). The best ones know their circle (e.g., 'I understand bond yields, but I have no idea about oil prices'). We trust the humble specialist over the arrogant generalist.\", \"quant\": \"Model Limits. Every algorithm has a circle of competence. A trend-following model works in trending markets but fails in chopping markets. A mean-reversion model works in range-bound markets but fails in breakouts. We must know the 'regime' where our models work and turn them off when they are outside their competence.\", \"technical\": \"Setup Mastery. Don't try to trade every pattern. Master one setup (e.g., bull flags, or head-and-shoulders). That is your circle of competence. Trade that setup aggressively when it appears, and sit on your hands when it doesn't.\", \"policy\": \"Jurisdictional moats. We prefer companies that operate in jurisdictions we understand. Analyzing a mining company in a war-torn nation with opaque laws is largely outside our circle of competence. We stick to rule-of-law jurisdictions where property rights are respected.\", \"tech\": \"Tech Niches. No one understands 'Tech' as a whole. It's too big. An analyst might be an expert in SaaS but clueless about semi-conductors. We segment our tech exposure based on specific sub-sector expertise.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Illusion of Competence. The Dunning-Kruger effect. You read one article about Lithium and think you are an expert on battery chemistry. This is dangerous. True competence comes from years of study and experience. Be honest with yourself about what you actually know versus what you think you know.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Stay in your circle. Expand it slowly, but never step outside it."
