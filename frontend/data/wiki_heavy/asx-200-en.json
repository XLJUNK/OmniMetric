        "summary": "The 'Global Mining & Finance' proxy. The ASX 200 tracks the largest companies in Australia, dominated by giant miners and the world's most stable banking sector.",
        "deep_dive": "In 2026, the ASX 200 is the ultimate play on the 'Commodity Super-cycle' and the rise of Southeast Asia. With miners like BHP and Rio Tinto, the index is a bet on the physical world. If data centers and high-speed rail are being built, the ASX is the 'Source Code' of those materials. Additionally, the Australian banking sector provides a high-yield, defensive floor for the index. For macro traders, the ASX is a 'Carry-Positive' equity market. When commodity prices are rising, the AUD strengthens and the ASX rallies, providing a double-win for global investors. It is the destination for capital seeking stability and yield in the Pacific region.",
