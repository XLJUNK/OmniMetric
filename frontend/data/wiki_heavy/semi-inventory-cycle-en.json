        "summary": "The Semiconductor Inventory Cycle, often measured by the Book-to-Bill ratio, is the heartbeat of the modern economy. It reflects the pulsing demand for chips, ranging from smartphones to AI data centers. Historically, this cycle leads the global ISM Manufacturing PMI by 3-6 months.",
        "deep_dive": "The 'Silicon Cycle' is notoriously boom-and-bust. It moves through four phases: shortage (ordering frenzy), equilibrium, glut (double ordering revealed), and correction (inventory write-downs). We are currently in a 'Super Cycle' where AI chips are in shortage while legacy chips are in correction.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Supply Chain Resilience is redefining the cycle. Companies are hoarding chips not because of demand, but because of geopolitical fear (China-Taiwan). This 'Just-in-Case' inventory builds a false floor under the cycle, making traditional inventory analysis tricky.\", \"macro\": \"Chips are the new oil. A downturn in this cycle is no longer just a tech sector problem; it's a global recession signal. If semi inventories bloat, it means the entire electronic supply chain is choking.\", \"quant\": \"Watch the 'Inventory Days' metric of major distributors. When it exceeds 120 days, a price collapse usually follows within 2 months. Currently, logic chip inventory is lean, but memory chip inventory is volatile.\", \"technical\": \"The SOX (Philly Semi Index) often forms a 'Double Bottom' six months before the inventory cycle actually bottoms. The stock market prices in the recovery long before the warehouse managers clear their shelves.\", \"policy\": \"The CHIPS Act and similar global subsidies are distorting the supply side. By subsidizing massive fab build-outs, governments are virtually guaranteeing a 'Supply Glut' in legacy nodes by 2027, even if AI demand stays strong.\", \"tech\": \"Edge AI is the next driver. We need a massive replacement cycle for PCs and Phones to run local LLMs (NPUs). This will trigger a new wave of demand for consumer-grade silicon, broadening the rally beyond just Nvidia data center chips.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The risk is 'Double Ordering' masking true demand. If 2026 sees a sudden drop in AI hype, the cancellation of orders could trigger the steepest inventory correction in history. The upside is the 'Edge AI Supercycle' extending the boom for another 3 years.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Accumulate on dips. We are in the 'Expansion' phase for AI silicon, but the 'Recovery' phase for consumer silicon. Buy the best-in-class names when the cycle signals 'Peak Fear'."
