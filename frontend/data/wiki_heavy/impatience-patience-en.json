        "summary": "The market transfers money from the impatient to the patient. Most mistakes (selling too early, buying too high, overtrading) are caused by impatience. Patience is not just waiting; it is an active state of maintaining discipline while the market does nothing.",
        "deep_dive": "Time is an edge. Retail traders often feel the need to 'do something' every day to feel productive. The professional knows that 90% of the time, the best trade is to do nothing. Capital preservation requires infinite patience; capital growth requires aggressive patience.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Strategic Patience. China plans in 100-year cycles. The US plans in 4-year cycles. This mismatch creates opportunities and risks. In geopolitical investing, betting on the player with the longer time horizon (patience) is often the winning strategy.\", \"macro\": \"The Long Game. Macro trends take years to play out (e.g., Demographics, Debt Cycles). If you are trading a 10-year trend with a 10-minute chart, you will get shaken out. Patience means aligning your timeframe with your thesis.\", \"quant\": \"Alpha Decay. High-frequency trading is about speed (impatience). Low-frequency investing is about patience. Alpha (excess return) is often found in the 'Time Premium'—getting paid to hold an asset that others are too impatient to hold.\", \"technical\": \"Waiting for Confirmation. The impatient trader buys the breakout *before* it happens (and gets trapped). The patient trader waits for the candle to close. We pay a slightly higher price for confirmation, but we buy a higher probability of success.\", \"policy\": \"Legislative Gridlock. Markets hate uncertainty and want quick policy fixes. But democracy is designed to be slow. Betting on quick legislative wins is usually a losing trade. Patience is required to navigate regulatory changes.\", \"tech\": \"Development Cycles. Software takes twice as long as expected. Biotech trials take years. Investing in innovation requires the patience to endure delays, pivots, and 'Valley of Death' periods before the product finds product-market fit.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Analysis Paralysis. The risk is that 'patience' becomes an excuse for inaction. There is a difference between waiting for a setup and being afraid to pull the trigger. Patience must end when the signal fires.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The hardest work in trading is waiting. Master the art of doing nothing until there is something to do."
