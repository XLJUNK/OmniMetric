        "summary": "Keynes' Warning. Being 'right' too early is indistinguishable from being wrong. Valuation bubbles (like the Dot-Com bubble) can persist for years, driving rational short-sellers into bankruptcy before the inevitable crash finally happens.",
        "deep_dive": "Attributed to John Maynard Keynes. It warns against 'Valuation Shorting'. Just because a stock is trading at 100x earnings doesn't mean it can't trade at 200x. The market is not a calculator; it's a voting machine driven by liquidity and emotion. Logic often takes a backseat to mania.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Political irrationality drives markets. A war might make 'no economic sense', but if a dictator is irrational, the market will price in that fear. We must hedge against the 'Madman Theory', not just assume rational state actors.\", \"macro\": \"Bubbles are rational responses to artificial credit. When Central Banks suppress rates to 0% for a decade, buying 'irrational' assets like non-profitable tech stocks becomes the 'rational' move to chase yield. The market is only irrational because the cost of money is fake.\", \"quant\": \"We model 'Bubbles' as 'Super-Exponential Growth' (Log-Periodic Power Law). We don't short the bubble until the acceleration breaks. Being early is a career-ending move. We need a catalyst (Trend Break) to confirm the irrationality is ending.\", \"technical\": \"Price is Truth. If the chart is going up, it's not irrational; it's demand. We don't judge the 'why'. We respect the 'what'. We only short when the chart confirms a reversal (Head and Shoulders, Lower Lows), never because 'it's too high'.\", \"policy\": \"We try to contain irrational exuberance (Greenspan), but we often fuel it. The 'Fed Put' encourages irrational risk-taking. Regulators often step in only AFTER the solvency crisis has begun (e.g., banning short-selling in 2008).\", \"tech\": \"Tech paradigms look irrational to incumbents. Amazon losing money for 20 years looked irrational to Retail Giants. Tesla's valuation looked irrational to Detroit. Sometimes the market is pricing in a future that 'Rational' analysts can't see yet.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The Short Squeeze. The hallmark of an irrational market is the vertical rally that forces short-sellers to cover (buy back), driving the price even higher. This feedback loop can bankrupt you even if your thesis is ultimately 100% correct.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Do not argue with the tape. If the market is irrational, participate with tight stops, or stand aside. Never stand in front of a freight train to prove a point."
