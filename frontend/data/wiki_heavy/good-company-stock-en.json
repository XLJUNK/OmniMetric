        "summary": "This maxim, popularized by Warren Buffett, marks the shift from 'Cigar Butt' investing (buying garbage companies because they are cheap) to 'Quality' investing. A great business with a wide moat can compound capital for decades. A mediocre business is a melting ice cube. It is worth paying a premium for quality.",
        "deep_dive": "The math of compounding favors quality. If a company can reinvest capital at 20% ROE for 20 years, it becomes a wealth-generating machine. You cannot get that from a 'cheap' stock that has no pricing power and is fighting for survival. Over the long run, the return of the stock will mirror the return of the business.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Sovereign Quality. We apply this to nations. It is better to invest in a 'Good Nation' (Rule of Law, stable demographics, innovation) at a 'Fair Price' (moderate valuation) than a 'Fair Nation' (corrupt, unstable) at a 'Good Price' (cheap). Cheap markets are usually cheap for a reason (risk of expropriation).\", \"macro\": \"Currency Quality. We prefer currencies of nations with positive real rates and trade surpluses (Quality) even if they are 'expensive', over currencies of nations with deficits and inflation (Junk) even if they are 'cheap'. Quality currencies tend to appreciate over time.\", \"quant\": \"Quality Factor. We screen for High ROIC, Low Debt, and Stable Margins. These are the hallmarks of quality. Our backtests show that the 'Quality' factor consistently outperforms the market over the long term, with lower volatility.\", \"technical\": \"Leaders vs. Laggards. We buy the leaders making new highs (Good Company at Fair Price), not the laggards making new lows (Fair Company at Good Price). Strength begets strength. Weakness begets weakness.\", \"policy\": \"Institutional Strength. We invest in sectors with strong institutional support and clear regulatory frameworks. A 'cheap' sector facing a regulatory crackdown is a value trap. A 'premium' sector with government backing is a compounder.\", \"tech\": \"Platform Power. In tech, the 'Good Company' is the platform (Apple, Microsoft). They own the ecosystem. It is worth paying a higher multiple for the platform because they tax the entire economy. A 'cheap' hardware maker is a commodity trap.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Valuation Risk. The risk is the 'Nifty Fifty' problem. Even a great company can be a bad investment if you pay too much (e.g., 50x earnings). 'Fair Price' is key. You don't need a bargain, but you can't pay infinity.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Quality is the best hedge against time."
