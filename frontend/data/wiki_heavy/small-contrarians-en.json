        "summary": "This maxim addresses the difficulty of timing contrarian trades. Being a contrarian is profitable but dangerous. If you bet against the herd too early, you get trampled. Therefore, you must start with a small position (a 'feeler') and only scale up when the price action confirms your thesis.",
        "deep_dive": "The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. A contrarian view is, by definition, fighting the current momentum. You need confirmation that the momentum is turning before you commit significant capital. The 'small start' buys you the time to be right.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Minority Reports. Intelligence agencies often ignore contrarian analysts (e.g., those predicting the fall of the Berlin Wall). Smart leaders fund 'Red Teams'—small groups paid to challenge the consensus. They don't bet the whole policy on the contrarian view, but they keep it alive as a hedge.\", \"macro\": \"Asymmetric Bets. We look for contrarian trades with convexity (limited downside, unlimited upside). For example, buying long-dated OTM puts on a bubble. The premium is small (start small), but the payoff is huge if the bubble bursts.\", \"quant\": \"Mean Reversion. Contrarian strategies rely on mean reversion. But trends can persist for 3-5 standard deviations. We use small position sizing to survive the 'fat tails' of the distribution until the mean reversion actually occurs.\", \"technical\": \"Bottom Fishing. Trying to catch a falling knife is dangerous. We buy a 'starter position' when the knife hits the floor, but we don't buy the 'full position' until the knife bounces (higher low). We let the market prove us right first.\", \"policy\": \"Pilot Programs. Governments should not roll out radical new policies nationwide immediately. They should run small pilot programs (contrarian experiments) in specific cities. If it works, scale it up. If it fails, the damage is contained.\", \"tech\": \"A/B Testing. When testing a radical new feature (contrarian design), we release it to 1% of users first. We don't change the entire interface overnight. We validate the contrarian hypothesis with small data before full deployment.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Confirmation Bias. The risk is that you take a small position and then 'marry' it. You start looking for evidence that supports your contrarian view and ignoring the price action that contradicts it. Even a small position requires discipline to cut if the thesis is wrong.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The pioneer gets the arrows. The settler gets the land. Don't be the first pioneer with all your capital."
