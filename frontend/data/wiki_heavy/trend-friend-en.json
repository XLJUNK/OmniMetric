        "summary": "The First Commandment of Trading. Don't row upstream. Markets exhibit persistence; an object in motion stays in motion. Fighting the trend requires infinite capital; riding it requires only patience.",
        "deep_dive": "This isn't just a cliche; it's physics. Momentum (serial covariance) is one of the few statistically proven market anomalies that has persisted for 200 years. The 'Trend' is simply the aggregate consensus of all market participants, backed by money. To bet against it is to say you know more than the collective trillions of the market.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Trends are policy in motion. The 40-year bond bull market (1981-2021) wasn't an accident; it was the trend of Globalization and Peace. Now, the trend is Deglobalization and Conflict. Do not fight the new secular trend of higher structural inflation.\", \"macro\": \"The Fed sets the trend. When the Fed is easing, the liquidity tide is rising. The trend is up. When they tighten, the tide goes out. 'Don't Fight the Fed' is a corollary. The 'Trend' is just a visualization of Liquidity Flows.\", \"quant\": \"We don't 'see' trends; we calculate them. Moving Averages, ADX, and Regression slopes. The strategy is 'Trend Following': buy high, sell higher. It has a low win rate (40%) but massive payoffs (fat tails). Being 'Contrarian' in a strong trend is statistically suicidal.\", \"technical\": \"Draw the line. As long as price is above the uptrend line (higher highs, higher lows), you are long. The moment the structure breaks, the friendship is over. Most traders lose money by trying to pick the 'Top' of a trend. The top is a process, not a point.\", \"policy\": \"We create trends to achieve stability. We signal 'Lower for Longer' to create a trend of investment. When we want to cool the economy, we try to engineer a trend reversal without a crash.\", \"tech\": \"Network Effects create exponential trends. Adoption of Bitcoin or AI follows an S-Curve. In the steep part of the S-Curve, the trend is violent and vertical. Only when saturation is reached does the trend die.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The Bend at the End. \"The Trend is your friend... until the bend at the end.\" Trends often end in a 'Blow-off Top' (parabolic spike) followed by a crash. The last 10% of the trend attracts the most naive capital.",
        "gms_conclusion": "It is easier to ride a horse in the direction it is already going. Align your portfolio with the dominant macro forces."
