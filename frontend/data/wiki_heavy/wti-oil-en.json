        "summary": "West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is the benchmark for US Crude Oil. It is the lifeblood of the industrialized world. Despite the green transition, the world still runs on 100 million barrels a day.",
        "deep_dive": "Oil is the 'Input Cost of Everything'. When oil rises, inflation rises. WTI specifically reflects US Shale dynamics. The US is now the world's largest oil producer, changing global geopolitical leverage.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"The Strait of Hormuz is the choke point. 20% of global oil flows through it. Any conflict involving Iran immediately adds a $10-$20 'War Premium' to various barrels. However, US domestic production acts as a buffer.\", \"macro\": \"Oil demand is the best real-time indicator of global economic activity. If China sneezes (slows down), Oil catches a cold. Currently, weak Chinese demand is keeping a lid on prices despite geopolitical wars.\", \"quant\": \"We watch the 'Crack Spread' (the profit margin for refining oil into gasoline). If Spreads are falling, refiners buy less crude. Currently, spreads are tight, suggesting weak end-user demand.\", \"technical\": \"The $65-$85 range is the 'Sweet Spot'. Below $65, OPEC+ cuts production to support price. Above $85, demand destruction kicks in and inflation spikes. We are currently range-bound.\", \"policy\": \"The 'OPEC Put' is real. Saudi Arabia needs oil at $80+ to fund its Neom mega-projects. They will defend the floor aggressively. Meanwhile, US strategic reserves (SPR) are low, leaving less room for government intervention.\", \"tech\": \"Fracking technology gains have peaked. US Shale production growth is slowing down. The 'Easy Oil' has been pumped. This raises the long-term floor price of oil ($70 instead of $50).\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "A rapid de-escalation in the Middle East removes the war premium, sending oil to $60. Conversely, a closure of the Strait of Hormuz sends it to $150 overnight.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Structurally higher floor due to lack of investment (ESG) and OPEC discipline. Essential hedge against geopolitical chaos."
