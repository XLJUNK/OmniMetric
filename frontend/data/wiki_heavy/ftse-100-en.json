        "summary": "The definitive 'Old Economy' bastion. Dominated by global miners, oil supermajors, and international banks. With 80% of revenues generated overseas, it trades inversely to the British Pound (GBP).",
        "deep_dive": "The FTSE 100 serves as a unique global hedge against USD liquidity shocks and stagflation. Due to its minimal tech exposure (<1%), it structurally outperforms the S&P 500 during high-interest rate regimes. The index is effectively a currency play: a crashing Pound inflates the repatriated earnings of its global constituents, creating a powerful negative correlation tailored for FX hedging strategies.",
        "council_debate": {
            "geopolitics": "Post-Brexit regulatory divergence remains a double-edged sword, but the core companies are multinational titans whose earnings are insulated from domestic UK political chaos.",
            "macro": "The ultimate stagflation vehicle. It thrives on high commodity prices and elevated rates, acting as the polar opposite of the Nasdaq 100.",
            "quant": "Valuations remain at a perpetual 30-40% discount to US peers. The dividend yield alone makes it a compelling safety trade for income-focused institutional capital.",
            "technical": "A multi-decade range-bound asset. Breakouts above historical highs require a synchronized rally in Crude Oil and Copper to sustain momentum.",
            "policy": "Domestic 'Windfall Taxes' on energy profits are a constant threat. Labour government fiscal policies are watched closely for impact on corporate tax rates.",
            "tech": "Zero AI exposure. While this means missed growth, it also means zero vulnerability to an AI valuation bubble burst."
        },
        "forecast_risks": "A global deflationary crash where commodities collapse and rates hit zero again, or a sudden strengthening of the GBP above 1.40 USD, which would crush translated earnings.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The dividend-paying fortress against a tech-bubble burst. Essential for diversification in a high-inflation, resource-constrained world."
