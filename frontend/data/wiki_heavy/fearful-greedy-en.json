        "summary": "This famous maxim by Warren Buffett succinctly captures the essence of contrarian investing. When the crowd is greedy (buying at any price, ignoring risk), the market is overpriced and due for a correction. When the crowd is fearful (selling at any price, ignoring value), the market is underpriced and offers opportunity.",
        "deep_dive": "Sentiment is a counter-indicator at extremes. When your taxi driver gives you stock tips, it is time to sell (Greed). When the cover of Time Magazine says 'The Death of Equities', it is time to buy (Fear). The smart money provides liquidity to the emotional money.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Crisis Alpha. When war breaks out, the crowd flees (Fear). We buy the dip in high-quality assets that are not directly affected. When peace is declared, the crowd rushes back in (Greed). We sell into the relief rally.\", \"macro\": \"Credit Spreads. Tight credit spreads indicate greed (no default fear). Wide spreads indicate fear. We buy corporate bonds when spreads are 'blowout' wide (maximum fear) and sell when they are historically tight.\", \"quant\": \"Put/Call Ratio. A high Put/Call ratio means everyone is buying protection (Fear). This is a bullish signal for us. A low Put/Call ratio means everyone is betting on upside (Greed). This is a bearish signal.\", \"technical\": \"RSI Extremes. RSI > 80 is Greed (Overbought). RSI < 20 is Fear (Oversold). We fade the extremes. However, in a strong trend, 'overbought' can stay overbought for a long time. We wait for the divergence.\", \"policy\": \"Bailouts. When the government panic-bails out an industry (maximum fear), it is the bottom. When regulators ignore a bubbling sector because 'innovation' (maximum greed), it is the top.\", \"tech\": \"FOMO Waves. Tech cycles are driven by FOMO. When you feel a physical pain from missing out on a rally, that is Greed taking over your brain. That is the exact moment to step away. When you feel physically sick about your portfolio, that is Fear. That is the moment to add.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Catching a Falling Knife. Buying fear is dangerous if the fear is justified (e.g., bankruptcy). You must differentiate between 'market panic' (price dislocation) and 'fundamental deterioration' (value destruction). Be greedy only in high-quality assets.",
        "gms_conclusion": "You cannot make money doing what everyone else is doing. You must stand apart from the crowd."
