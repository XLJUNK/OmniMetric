        "deep_dive": "EUR/USD is the 'Anti-Dollar'. When the global economy is in a synchronized recovery, EUR/USD typically rises as capital flows out of safe-haven Dollars and into European industrial growth. In 2026, the Euro is navigating a 'Post-Energy Crisis' landscape. While the EU has diversified away from Russian gas, the structural cost of doing business in Europe remains higher than in the US. This creates a permanent headwind for the Euro. For macro traders, breaking above 1.10 signals a 'Global Risk-On' regime, while falling below Parity (1.00) indicates a systemic crisis in European banking or energy.",
