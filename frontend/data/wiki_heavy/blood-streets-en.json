        "summary": "Rothschild's Dictum. The best buying opportunities occur during periods of maximum peril, panic, and uncertainty. When everyone else is selling at any price to escape, you must step in and provide liquidity.",
        "deep_dive": "Attributed to Baron Rothschild during the Panic of 1810 or Waterloo. The full quote adds: '...even if the blood is your own'. This implies that you must buy even when you are personally suffering losses and fear. It is the ultimate test of emotional discipline.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"We buy conflict. Markets often bottom when the first shots are fired (the uncertainty resolves into localized certainty). Buying the invasion of Kuwait (1990) or the invasion of Ukraine (2022) was profitable. We fade the initial panic.\", \"macro\": \"Liquidity Crises are buying opportunities. When the financial system seizes up (2008, 2020), Central Banks are forced to intervene with massive liquidity injections. We 'front-run' the Fed. The 'Blood' is the signal that the Fed Put is about to trigger.\", \"quant\": \"We measure 'Capitulation'. We look for specific signals: VIX > 40, 95% of stocks below 200DMA, record outflows from equity funds. When these metrics align, the algorithms buy aggressively. It's mean reversion math, not bravery.\", \"technical\": \"Selling Climax. We look for a massive red candle on record volume that closes well off its lows (a 'Hammer' or 'Pinbar'). This indicates that all sellers have sold, and buyers stepped in to absorb the supply. The 'Blood' has been mopped up.\", \"policy\": \"We buy the bailout. When Congress passes emergency legislation (TARP in 2008, CARES Act in 2020), the bottom is in. The government cannot afford a total collapse. 'Blood in the streets' forces political unity and stimulus.\", \"tech\": \"Tech wrecks are brutal but profitable. Buying Amazon at $6 in 2001 (down 94%) required nerves of steel. In Tech, 'Blood' often means a paradigm shift is being questioned. If the paradigm is real (e.g., Internet), the crash is a gift.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Catching a Falling Knife. Sometimes the blood is justified. Buying Russian stocks in 1917 or Chinese stocks in 1949 resulted in a 100% loss. You must ensure the 'Rule of Law' and 'Property Rights' will survive the crisis.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Fortune favors the bold. The lower it goes, the safer it is (if solvency remains). Panic is your friend."
