The transition to green energy and the building of AI data centers require a total overhaul of the global power grid. This 'Great Re-wiring' is the largest investment cycle in history. Infrastructure assets are protected from inflation by 'Long-term Contracts' that often have CPI-linked escalators. For macro traders, this sector is a play on 'Fiscal Policy'—governments are spending trillions on 'Reshoring' their industrial bases, and infrastructure firms are the primary beneficiaries of this state-led growth.",
