        "summary": "Discipline beats emotion. Before you enter any trade, you must define: 1. Entry price, 2. Stop-loss price (invalidation), 3. Take-profit price (target). Once the trade is live, emotions (fear/greed) take over. Following the pre-written plan protects you from your own psychology.",
        "deep_dive": "This maxim is about removing 'Decision Fatigue' and 'Emotional Bias' from active trading. In the heat of battle (when money is fluctuating rapidly), the human brain reverts to 'Fight or Flight'. A plan acts as a pre-commitment contract that overrides this primitive response.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Scenario Planning. Military leaders war-game every possible outcome before the first shot is fired. We do the same. 'If China invades Taiwan, we sell Apple and buy Raytheon.' We don't wait for the invasion to decide. The plan is ready in the drawer.\", \"macro\": \"Thesis Verification. A trade is based on a thesis (e.g., 'Inflation is peaking'). The plan tracks data points that confirm or deny the thesis. If CPI comes in hot, the thesis is broken, and we exit. We trade the data, not the hope.\", \"quant\": \"Algorithmic Execution. Algorithms are the ultimate 'Plan Your Trade' machines. They have zero emotion. They execute the code exactly as written. Humans should try to emulate this robotic execution. Discretionary trading without a plan is just gambling.\", \"technical\": \"IF-THEN Logic. Technical analysis is a series of IF-THEN statements. 'IF price breaks $100 resistance, THEN buy with stop at $95 and target at $110.' If the condition is not met, there is no trade. We are snipers, not machine gunners.\", \"policy\": \"Central Bank Forward Guidance. Even the Fed plans its trades. They telegraph rate hikes months in advance ('Forward Guidance') to avoid shocking the market. They signal their plan, then execute it. Investors should follow this deliberate, transparent approach.\", \"tech\": \"Roadmaps. Software development requires a product roadmap. You don't just start coding random features. You act according to the spec. Trading is no different. The 'Spec' is your trade plan. Don't ship bugs (bad trades) by deviating from the spec.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Rigidity. A plan is not a suicide pact. If new information changes the fundamental reality (e.g., a CEO is arrested, a war starts), you must be able to adapt. 'Strong opinions, loosely held.' Update the plan, then trade the new plan.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Amateurs guess. Professionals plan. If you don't have a written plan for a trade, you are the liquidity for someone who does."
