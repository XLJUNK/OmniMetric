        "summary": "Fear is fuel. A healthy Bull Market is one where everyone is skeptical. If everyone is terrified of a recession, war, or inflation, they are holding cash. This cash on the sidelines is potential buying power that will push the market higher as the fears slowly fade.",
        "deep_dive": "Markets peak on Euphoria, not Fear. When the news is perfect and everyone is celebrating, there is no one left to buy (a top). When the news is terrible and everyone is worried, the market climbs the 'Wall of Worry' because expectations are so low that any 'less bad' news is bullish.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Crisis fatigue. The market gets used to bad news. The first day of war crashes the market. The 100th day of war is ignored. The Wall of Worry is built on the market's ability to desensitize itself to geopolitical pain.\", \"macro\": \"The 'Most Hated Rally'. We love rallies that macro economists hate. If economists say 'This rally makes no sense because GDP is slowing', that is bullish. It means the market is looking past the slowdown to the recovery. When economists finally agree the rally is justified, it's over.\", \"quant\": \"Put/Call Ratio. We measure the 'Worry' via the Put/Call ratio. A high ratio (lots of protection/puts bought) means the market is hedged. A hedged market rarely crashes because the selling has already been done (via puts). Short covering drives the climb.\", \"technical\": \"Divergence. We look for price making new highs while volatility (VIX) remains elevated. This 'Fear Bid' confirms the Wall of Worry. The trend is up, but the crowd is scared. This is the sweetest spot of the cycle.\", \"policy\": \"The Fed's worry is our safety net. If the Fed is worried about the economy, they will be dovish (stimulative). A 'Wall of Worry' for the economy is often a 'Wall of Liquidity' for the market.\", \"tech\": \"Scepticism of Innovation. 'The Internet is a fad.' 'Bitcoin is a scam.' 'AI is a bubble.' This skepticism allows the trend to grow sustainability. If everyone believed in it on Day 1, it would bubble and burst immediately. Doubt extends the runway.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The Slope of Hope. The opposite is a Bear Market sliding down a 'Slope of Hope'. Traders keep buying the dip hoping for a turnkey recovery, only to be crushed. You must identify if the trend is Up (Wall of Worry) or Down (Slope of Hope).",
        "gms_conclusion": "If the news is bad but the market is up, buy. The market is telling you the worry is priced in."
