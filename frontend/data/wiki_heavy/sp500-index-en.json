        "summary": "The S&P 500 is the leading benchmark for US equity performance. However, due to the dominance of the 'Magnificent 7', it closely resembles a Global Tech ETF rather than a diversified proxy for the US domestic economy.",
        "deep_dive": "Historically, the index returned 7-9% annually. In the AI era, earnings growth for the top tech companies is pushing 20-30%, causing the index to trade at higher structural valuation multiples (PE Ratios). The distortion between the 'Weighted' S&P 500 and the 'Equal Weight' S&P 500 (RSP) tells the real story.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"When Europe stagnates and China deflates, global capital has nowhere to go but US markets. The S&P 500 is the 'cleanest dirty shirt' in the global laundry basket.\", \"macro\": \"We are watching 'Profit Margins'. Despite inflation, companies have maintained record margins. If labor costs rise faster than prices, margins compress, and the S&P 500 drops 20%.\", \"quant\": \"Concentration risk is at 1929 and 1999 levels. The Top 10 stocks make up 35% of the index. Passive investing flows (ETFs) blindly buy these top stocks, creating a momentum feedback loop.\", \"technical\": \"The 6000 level is the psychological barrier. Above that, we are in 'Melt-Up' territory. Support is strong at the 50-day moving average. A weekly close below the 200-day is the only sell signal we respect.\", \"policy\": \"The 2017 Tax Cuts expire in 2025. If corporate tax rates jump from 21% to 28%, S&P 500 earnings estimates fall 10% overnight. This is the biggest political risk.\", \"tech\": \"AI CapEx is currently a cost, but soon it becomes revenue. If Microsoft and Google can monetize their AI spend, the S&P 500 is cheap. If not, it's an AI bubble bursting like 2000.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The 'Passive Bubble' burst. If liquidity dries up, everyone trying to sell passive ETFs at once could reveal no liquidity in the underlying individual stocks, causing a 'Flash Crash'.",
        "gms_conclusion": "No longer just an index, it's a global liquidity sponge. Stay long, but hedge with Volatility (VIX) calls if the Top 7 stocks stagger."
