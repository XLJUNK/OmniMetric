        "summary": "The 'Land of the Rising Yield'. The Nikkei 225 tracks the top companies in Japan. After 30 years of stagnation, it has entered a new 'Structural Bull Market' in 2024-2026.",
        "deep_dive": "In 2026, Japan is no longer a 'Value Trap'. Governance reforms have forced Japanese companies to return cash to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Coupled with a weak Yen and the return of mild inflation, the Nikkei has become a favorite for global asset allocators. It is a 'High-Beta' play on global tech and autos, but with the added benefit of being a 'Pro-Inflation' hedge. As Japan leaves behind its deflationary era, domestic consumers and corporations are finally spending. For institutional investors, the Nikkei is the 'Quality Industrial' alternative to the US, providing exposure to 'Deep Tech' and robotics without extreme valuations.",
