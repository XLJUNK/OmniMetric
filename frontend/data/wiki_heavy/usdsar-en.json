        "deep_dive": "The USD/SAR peg is the foundation of the 'Petro-Dollar' system that has ruled global finance since 1974. In 2026, this peg is under intense scrutiny as Saudi Arabia (Vision 2030) seeks to diversify its economy and potentially trade oil in other currencies (like CNY). If the Saudi Riyal were to ever 'De-peg' or 'Float', it would signal the end of the US Dollar's absolute dominance over the energy trade. For macro traders, watching the 'USD/SAR Forwards' is the ultimate way to detect 'Under-the-surface' stress in the Middle East. If forwards spike, the market is betting the peg will break. For now, it remains the ultimate 'Stable' anchor in the volatile world of energy and geopolitics.",
