        "summary": "The 'Plumbing Stabilizer'. A policy where the US Treasury buys back 'Off-the-run' (less liquid) bonds to ensure smooth function of the debt market.",
        "deep_dive": "In 2026, Treasury Buybacks are the 'Secret Quantitative Easing'. While the Fed may be tightening, the Treasury is effectively providing liquidity by ensuring the world's most important market—US Government Debt—remains liquid. This program prevents 'Bond Flash Crashes' and keeps the MOVE Index (Bond Vol) under control. It is the ultimate measure of 'Fiscal Dominance'—the point where the government must intervene in its own debt auctions to prevent a systemic failure. For macro traders, this is the signal that the 'Liquidator of Last Resort' is now the Treasury Department, not just the Federal Reserve.",

            "quant": "Quants trade the 'On-the-run' vs 'Off-the-run' spread, but this program is structurally narrowing that arbitrage profit.",
            "tech": "The 'Digital Bond' transition in 2027 will eventually replace this manual buyback system with automated liquidity pools.",
            "geopolitics": "Ensures the US Dollar remains the 'Safest' asset by guaranteeing that you can always sell your Treasuries for a fair price.",
