        "deep_dive": "The 2026 REIT landscape is a 'Tale of Two Cities'. While traditional Office REITs struggle with 20% vacancy rates, 'Specialized' REITs are booming. Institutional capital is flowing into Data Centers, Cell Towers, and Cold Storage. These are no longer viewed as 'Property' but as 'Essential Tech Infrastructure'. REITs are hyper-sensitive to the 10-Year Treasury yield; because they pay out 90% of their income, they compete with bonds for capital. In a 'Higher for Longer' rate environment, only the REITs with low debt-to-equity can sustain their distributions. For macro traders, REITs often bottom 8-12 weeks before the S&P 500 when interest rates finally peak.",
