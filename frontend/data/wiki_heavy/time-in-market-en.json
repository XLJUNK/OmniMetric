        "summary": "Compounding requires patience. Missing just the 10 best trading days in 20 years can cut your returns in half. While traders obsess over 'timing the bottom', investors focus on 'time in the asset'. Wealth is built by sitting, not by trading.",
        "deep_dive": "Statistically proven by multiple studies (JP Morgan, Fidelity). The best days often follow the worst days. If you panic-sell on a -5% day, you often miss the +6% recovery rally the next week. The cost of being 'out' during a recovery far exceeds the benefit of dodging a dip.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Political noise creates volatility, which tempts timing. 'Sell because the election is scary.' But history shows that over 4-year election cycles, the market goes up regardless of the party in power. We stay invested through the noise.\", \"macro\": \"Inflation erodes cash. The biggest risk of 'market timing' is sitting in cash while its purchasing power evaporates. 'Time in the Market' is really 'Time out of Cash'. Real assets (stocks, gold) are the only hedge against the certainty of currency debasement.\", \"quant\": \"We can't time the market consistently. Even the best algorithms have a 53-55% hit rate. But the 'Drift' (long-term upward trend) is 100% consistent over 20-year periods. We bet on the drift (Beta), not the timing (Alpha).\", \"technical\": \"Trend Followers don't time tops or bottoms. We capture the middle 60%. 'Time in the Market' for us means staying in the trend until the trend breaks. We don't try to guess the turn; we wait for the chart to tell us to leave.\", \"policy\": \"Tax efficiency favors time. Long-term capital gains tax is lower than short-term. Compounding is interrupted by taxes every time you sell. The government rewards you for doing nothing (holding) and penalizes you for activity (trading).\", \"tech\": \"Technological deflation. In Tech, 'Time in the Market' is dangerous if you hold the wrong asset (e.g., Yahoo, Nokia). But if you hold the 'Protocol' or the 'Platform' (Nasdaq 100), you capture the aggregate productivity growth of humanity.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The 'Dead Money' Decade. Time in the market didn't work from 1929-1954 or 1966-1982 or 2000-2013 (in real terms). Sometimes 'Time' is just 'Waiting to get back to even'. This maxim assumes a secular bull market.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Perfect timing is impossible. Perfect patience is difficult but possible. Choose patience."
