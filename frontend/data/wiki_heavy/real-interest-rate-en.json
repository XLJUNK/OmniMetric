    "summary": "The Real Interest Rate is the precise cost of money after accounting for inflation. Defined as the Nominal Interest Rate (e.g., 10Y Treasury Yield) minus the Expected Inflation Rate (Breakeven Inflation). It is the primary determinant of capital expenditure (CAPEX), gold prices, and equity valuations, acting as the 'gravity' of the financial universe.",
    "deep_dive": "Historically, ultra-low or negative real rates drove the post-2008 bull market. In the 2026 regime, we have shifted to a 'Positive Real Rate' world due to higher neutral rates (r-star) driven by Algorithmic Intelligence productivity. This structural shift penalizes unprofitable growth companies and zombies, forcing capital discipline.",
    "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"High real rates are a strategic asset for the USD but a liability for US diplomacy. Emerging markets with dollar-denominated debt are crushed by positive real yields, increasing the risk of sovereign defaults and pushing nations toward the BRICS+ bloc.\", \"macro\": \"The 'Neutral Rate' (r*) has clearly jumped. We used to think 0.5% was normal; now 1.5-2.0% is the new floor. This means a 4.5% nominal yield isn't actually 'tight' policy anymore—it's just neutral. Adjust your valuation models accordingly.\", \"quant\": \"I track the correlation between Real Rates and Gold. Historically inverse (-0.9), this correlation is weakening (-0.6) due to central bank buying. However, the correlation with 'Unprofitable Tech' remains strictly inverse (-0.95). High real rates equal death for long-duration cash flow assets.\", \"technical\": \"Real rates (TIPS yields) are forming a 'Cup and Handle' pattern on the monthly chart. A breakout above 2.5% would be a catastrophic technical signal for the S&P 500, targeting a 20% correction in multiples.\", \"policy\": \"The Fed MUST keep real rates positive to prevent the 1970s style inflation recurrence. They will tolerate a mild recession to maintain credibility. Do not expect real rates to dive back to negative unless we break something big.\", \"tech\": \"Algorithmic Intelligence deflation is the wildcard. If Algorithmic Intelligence drives massive price drops in services (deflation), real rates could spike passively even if nominal yields stay flat. This 'Passive Tightening' is the sleeper risk for 2026.\"}",
    "forecast_risks": "Risk of an 'Algorithmic Intelligence Deflation Shock' causing real rates to spike to 3%+, triggering a credit event in commercial real estate. Conversely, fiscal dominance could force the Fed to cap nominal rates while inflation runs hot, pushing real rates negative again (Mega-Bullish for Hard Assets).",
    "gms_conclusion": "The current Real Rate of ~2.0% is restrictive. As long as this persists, P/E expansion is mathematically capped. Favor assets with high free cash flow yields that exceed the risk-free real rate."
