        "summary": "The Army behind the General. Market Breadth measures the number of stocks participating in a move. If the S&P 500 hits new highs but only 10 stocks are rising (narrow breadth), the rally is fragile. If 400 stocks rise (strong breadth), the rally is robust.",
        "deep_dive": "Common metrics: Advance-Decline Line, New Highs vs. New Lows, and % of stocks above their 200-day Moving Average. A 'Breadth Thrust' (extreme buying pressure) often signals the start of a new bull market.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Broad participation signals national confidence. When a country's entire equity market rises, domestic capital is mobilized. If only export-giants rise while domestic small-caps fall, it signals internal economic rot masked by global trade.\", \"macro\": \"Liquidity lifts all boats. Strong breadth confirms that the central bank's liquidity is effectively permeating the real economy, not just chasing a few AI darlings. Weak breadth suggests a liquidity trap.\", \"quant\": \"We measure the 'Zweig Breadth Thrust'. If Advancing issues outnumbered Declining issues by 2:1 over a 10-day period, the probability of a continued uptrend is statistically significant (over 80%). We leverage up on breadth thrusts.\", \"technical\": \"Divergence Warning. The most dangerous signal in finance is when the Index makes a higher high, but the Advance-Decline Line makes a lower low. This happened in 1929, 2000, and 2008. The generals are leading, but the soldiers have fled.\", \"policy\": \"Fiscal stimulus targets specific sectors (narrow breadth). Monetary stimulus targets the whole system (wide breadth). We judge the type of stimulus by observing its effect on market breadth.\", \"tech\": \"Altseason is Breadth. In Crypto, Bitcoin dominance falling while Total Market Cap rises is the definition of expanding breadth. It means money is rotating from the safety of BTC into the risk of Alts.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Index Distortion. Cap-weighted indices like the S&P 500 can be heavily distorted by mega-caps. Breadth is the lie detector for the index, but it can be early. A narrow rally can persist for months before collapsing.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The Generals can only hold the line for so long without the Army. Watch the Breadth for the true health of the market."
