        "summary": "Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency. It is censorship-resistant, verifiable, and scarce money. It is the only asset in the world with a perfectly known supply schedule (21 million Cap).",
        "deep_dive": "Bitcoin solves the 'Byzantine Generals Problem', allowing consensus without a central authority. It has evolved from 'Magic Internet Money' to a geopolitical neutral reserve asset. Its 4-year Halving cycle drives its supply shock economics.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Bitcoin is 'stateless money'. For nations locked out of the SWIFT system or suffering from hyperinflation (Argentina, Turkey), it is a lifeline. It is the first separation of Money and State.\", \"macro\": \"It is the fastest horse in the 'Debasement Derby'. As fiat currencies lose purchasing power due to endless printing, Bitcoin acts as a high-beta absorbant of global liquidity.\", \"quant\": \"We model Bitcoin not as a currency, but as 'Veblen Good' commodity. Its correlation with the Nasdaq 100 is high, but it decouples during banking crises (like March 2023), acting as a flight to safety.\", \"technical\": \"We track the 'Power Law Corridor'. Bitcoin has never broken below its long-term logarithmic adoption curve. The 'MVRV Z-Score' is our primary top/bottom indicator. Currently, on-chain metrics show long-term holders are accumulating.\", \"policy\": \"The approval of Spot ETFs in the US was the crossing of the Rubicon. Wall Street can no longer ban it; they now sell it. This brings massive passive inflows that ignore the ideological arguments.\", \"tech\": \"The protocol is ossified, and that is a feature, not a bug. Stability is paramount for a store of value. Innovation (speed, privacy) is happening on Layer 2 (Lightning Network).\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Regulatory attack vectors are closing, but 'Taxation' remains the biggest threat. Governments could impose unrealized capital gains taxes. Also, a '51% Attack' is theoretically possible but economically suicidal for miners.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The asymmetric bet of our lifetime. It is insurance against monetary failure. Allocation should be non-zero."
