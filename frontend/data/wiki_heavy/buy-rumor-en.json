        "summary": "Efficient Market Anticipation. Markets price in future events *before* they happen. By the time the news is officially released, the smart money has already positioned itself and is looking for liquidity to exit. The 'News' is their exit liquidity.",
        "deep_dive": "This phenomenon explains why assets often drop on good earnings reports or regulatory approvals. The price had already run up in anticipation. If the news is 'Good' but not 'Great', it's a disappointment relative to expectations. The 'Rumor' builds the premium; the 'News' collapses it.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Leaks run the world. In diplomacy, the 'Rumor' is the whisper of a treaty. The 'News' is the signing ceremony. We trade the whisper. By the time the handshake is on CNN, the edge is gone. We monitor diplomatic flight logs for rumors.\", \"macro\": \"Fed Pivot pricing. The market rallies months *before* the first rate cut. It buys the rumor of the pivot. When the Fed actually cuts rates (the News), the market often sells off because the cut confirms the economy is weak. The anticipation is sweeter than the reality.\", \"quant\": \"We measure 'Implied Volatility' (IV) acting as the Rumor. IV rises before an event (Earnings, CPI). We sell the news by selling options (crushing IV) immediately after the event. The direction doesn't matter; the collapse of uncertainty (News) yields profit.\", \"technical\": \"The 'Run-up' vs. The 'Distribution'. The chart shows a steady climb into the event (buying the rumor). At the event, we see a 'Doji' or 'Shooting Star' candle on massive volume. This is the transfer of inventory from professionals (selling news) to retail (buying news).\", \"policy\": \"Legislators trade rumors. Tracking Congressional trading disclosures reveals that they often buy sectors before legislation is public (the Rumor). We follow the 'Nancy Pelosi Tracker' to buy the rumor with the insiders.\", \"tech\": \"Product Launches. Apple stock often runs up before an iPhone launch event and drops during the keynote speech. The innovation is already priced in. Unless there is a 'One More Thing' surplus surprise, the news is a sell.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The Surprise Factor. Sometimes the news is *better* than the rumor (e.g., Nvidia earnings beating lofty expectations). Selling the news in a hyper-growth scenario can result in getting run over. You must gauge if the market is 'Over-positioned'.",
        "gms_conclusion": "If it's in the newspaper, it's in the price. Trade the anticipation, not the headline."
