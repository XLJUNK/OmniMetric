        "summary": "Opinions are cheap; price is truth. This maxim warns against listening to pundits, news, or your own ego. The only thing that matters is what the market is actually doing. If the market disagrees with your analysis, the market is right, and you are wrong.",
        "deep_dive": "This is the essence of 'Price Action Trading'. The market is a mechanism that aggregates all information. If a company reports 'bad news' but the stock goes up, the market is telling you the bad news was already priced in. Listen to the reaction, not the news.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Propaganda Filter. Governments lie. Media spins. Price doesn't lie. If a leader says 'There will be no war,' but the price of Oil spikes and Defense stocks rally, the market knows war is coming. We trust the flow of money over the flow of words.\", \"macro\": \"Data Lag. Macro data (GDP, CPI) is backward-looking. The market is forward-looking. The Yield Curve often inverts *before* the recession data appears. If you wait for the data to confirm the recession, you are too late. The market has already spoken.\", \"quant\": \"Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). While we don't believe markets are perfectly efficient, they are 'efficient enough' to beat most individuals. The collective wisdom of millions of participants is usually smarter than any single analyst. Bet with the consensus of money (trend), not against it.\", \"technical\": \"Tape Reading. We watch the 'Tape' (Order Flow). Are big buyers stepping in at support? Is volume confirming the move? We don't ask 'Why is it going up?' We just ask 'Is it going up?' and 'Is there volume behind it?'.\", \"policy\": \"Fed Speak vs. Fed Action. The Fed might talk hawkishly, but if they are injecting liquidity (Repo), the market will rally. Consult the Fed's balance sheet, not their speeches. Actions speak louder than press conferences.\", \"tech\": \"Adoption Curves. Tech pundits might hate a product (e.g., initial reaction to AirPods), but if the sales numbers (market adoption) are vertical, the pundits are wrong. We look for 'Product-Market Fit' as defined by user growth, not critical acclaim.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Market Manipulation. Sometimes the market *is* lying, or at least being manipulated by whales or central banks (e.g., 'Plunge Protection Team'). Short-term price action can be deceptive (spoofing). You need to distinguish between noise and signal.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The market is a stern teacher. If you argue with it, you lose money. If you listen to it, you learn."
