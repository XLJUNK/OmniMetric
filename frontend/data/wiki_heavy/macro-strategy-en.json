        "summary": "Global Macro is the 'Game of Kings'. It involves betting on the economic and geopolitical direction of nations. It is the only strategy that can profit from any asset class in any market condition.",
        "deep_dive": "Unlike stock picking (bottom-up), Global Macro is top-down. We analyze interest rates, currency flows, government policy, and wars. We don't care about a company's CEO; we care about the Federal Reserve Chairman.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Markets are downstream of politics. A trade war, a kinetic war, or an election outcome can override any fundamentals. We position for the 'Tail Risks' that others ignore.\", \"macro\": \"The business cycle is the heartbeat. We identify where we are in the cycle (Growth, Slowdown, Recession, Recovery) and allocate assets accordingly. Currently, we are in 'Late Cycle' volatility.\", \"quant\": \"We use systematic trend-following models across 50+ markets. We look for 'Fat Tails' (outsized moves). When a trend is established, we ride it until it breaks. Human emotion is a liability; price action is truth.\", \"technical\": \"Price is the final arbiter. Even if the macro thesis is perfect, if the price isn't confirming, we cut the trade. We use 'Intermarket Analysis' (e.g., Bond Yields vs. Utility Stocks) to confirm validity.\", \"policy\": \"'Don't Fight the Fed'. Liquidity rules everything. If central banks are printing, we buy hard assets. If they are tightening, we hold cash. Understanding the 'Plumbing' of the financial system is key.\", \"tech\": \"Technology is a deflationary force. It disrupts traditional economic models (Phillips Curve). We are betting on the exponential age where Algorithmic Intelligence productivity clashes with heavy debt burdens.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The 'Correlations of 1' events. In a liquidity crash, all asset classes (Stocks, Bonds, Gold, Crypto) fall together. The only hedge is Volatility (Long VIX) or Cash (USD).",
        "gms_conclusion": "The ultimate form of investing. It requires a synthesis of history, economics, psychology, and math. Adapt or die."
