        "summary": "This maxim, popularized by Peter Lynch, emphasizes the importance of conviction. You cannot rely on borrowed ideas. When the market crashes, you need to know exactly why you own a stock to have the confidence to hold it. If you only bought it because someone else told you to, you will sell at the bottom.",
        "deep_dive": "Investment is not about the ticker symbol; it is about the business. 'Knowing what you own' means understanding the business model, the balance sheet, and the competitive advantage. 'Knowing why you own it' means having a clear thesis (e.g., 'I own this because they are gaining market share in cloud computing'). If the thesis breaks, you sell. If the price breaks but the thesis is intact, you buy more.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Strategic Assets. Nations must know what they own (critical infrastructure). If a foreign adversary owns your ports or power grid, you have lost sovereignty. 'Knowing why you own it' means understanding the strategic value of assets beyond their economic value.\", \"macro\": \"Currency Reserves. Central banks hold reserves (Gold, USD, EUR). They need to know why. Are they holding USD for trade settlement or for geopolitical leverage? The 'why' determines the strategy when the currency fluctuates.\", \"quant\": \"Factor Exposure. Quants don't own 'stocks'; they own 'factors' (value, momentum, quality). We need to know our factor exposure. If we think we own a 'tech' portfolio but it's actually just a 'high beta' portfolio, we will be surprised when it crashes with the broader market.\", \"technical\": \"Setup Validation. We don't just own a 'chart'; we own a specific setup (e.g., bull flag breakout). We know *why* we own it: because price is above support. If price falls below support, the 'why' is gone, and we sell.\", \"policy\": \"Regulatory Moats. Sometimes the 'why' is a regulatory advantage. We own a utility company because it has a government-granted monopoly. If the policy changes (deregulation), the 'why' evaporates.\", \"tech\": \"Tech Stack. You need to know what technology you are actually betting on. Are you betting on the hardware (Nvidia) or the software (Microsoft)? Are you betting on the protocol (Ethereum) or the application (Uniswap)? Precision matters.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Style Drift. The risk is forgetting *why* you bought it. You bought a stock as a 'growth' play, but growth slows. You keep holding it because it pays a dividend (now it's a 'value' play). This is style drift. If the original thesis is dead, sell it. Don't invent a new thesis to justify holding a loser.",
        "gms_conclusion": "If you can't explain why you own it to a 10-year-old in two minutes, don't own it."
