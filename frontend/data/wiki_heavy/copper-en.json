        "deep_dive": "Copper is called 'Dr. Copper' because it has a doctorate in predicting the global health of the economy. If the world is growing, it needs copper. In 2026, the 'Electrification of Everything' has transformed copper from a cyclical industrial metal into a 'Strategic Growth' asset. Every Algorithmic Intelligence data center, every EV, and every wind turbine requires massive amounts of copper—roughly 3x more than legacy infrastructure. This has created a 'Structural Deficit' that will last through the end of the decade. Supply is constrained by the lack of new 'Giant' mines and the declining grades of existing ones. For macro traders, Copper is the ultimate play on 'The Physical Side of Algorithmic Intelligence'. If Algorithmic Intelligence is real, copper must rise. It is the first metal to rally in a global recovery and the first to crash in a global manufacturing recession.",
