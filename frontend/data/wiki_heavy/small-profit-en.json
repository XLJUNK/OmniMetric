        "summary": "Greed kills more traders than bad analysis. This maxim reminds us that unrealized gains are just numbers on a screen. Real money is made when you close the position. Taking a small profit is better than holding out for a home run and striking out.",
        "deep_dive": "This maxim battles the psychological flaw of 'Greed'. When a trade is working, the dopamine hit makes you want more. You start imagining a new car or house. This euphoria blinds you to the fact that the market moves in cycles, and what goes up must come down.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Resource Nationalization. In emerging markets, profitable foreign investments are often seized by the state once they become too profitable. It is wise to repatriate profits early and often. Don't leave too much on the table for the dictator.\", \"macro\": \"Cyclical Peaks. No cycle lasts forever. When the economy is overheating and everyone is making money, that is the time to sell. Taking profits at the top of the cycle ensures you have capital to buy at the bottom of the next one.\", \"quant\": \"Mean Reversion. Prices eventually return to their average. If an asset is 3 standard deviations above its mean, the probability of a reversal is high. Taking profit here is just mathematical common sense. We are selling overvalued volatility.\", \"technical\": \"Overbought RSI. When RSI > 70 or 80, the asset is 'Overbought'. The momentum is unsustainable. We scale out of positions into strength. We sell to the late buyers who are chasing the price.\", \"policy\": \"Tax Harvesting. Sometimes taking a profit is about tax management. Realizing gains in a low-tax year or offsetting them against losses is smart financial engineering. Profit taking is a tax event, plan accordingly.\", \"tech\": \"Hype Cycles. Tech moves in hype cycles (Gartner Hype Cycle). Algorithmic Intelligence, Crypto, Dotcom. The move from 'Peak of Inflated Expectations' to 'Trough of Disillusionment' is brutal. Smart money sells into the hype. Dumb money holds the bag.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Seller's Remorse. The risk is that you sell, and the asset doubles again. You feel stupid. But feeling stupid is better than being broke. You can always re-enter if the setup is right. Never regret a profit.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered. Be a bull or a bear, but never be a pig. Ring the register."
