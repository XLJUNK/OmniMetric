        "summary": "The Algorithmic Intelligence Demand Forecast Index is OmniMetric's proprietary leading indicator that integrates Hyperscaler Capex plans, GPU lead times, and Data Center energy consumption. It serves as the 'Dr. Copper' of the digital age, predicting future economic activity via compute demand.",
        "deep_dive": "This index tracks the 'three pillars' of Algorithmic Intelligence infrastructure: 1) Compute (Silicon), 2) Energy (nuclear/renewables), and 3) Data (training sets). A divergence where Capex rises but Token Consumption flatlines is the ultimate signal of an 'Algorithmic Intelligence Bubble' forming.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"'Sovereign Algorithmic Intelligence' is the new space race. Nations typically allocate budget for defense; now they allocate it for GPUs. This guarantees a floor for demand that private markets cannot account for. The US-China chip ban divides the world into two distinct Algorithmic Intelligence ecosystems.\", \"macro\": \"Algorithmic Intelligence is the only deflationary force strong enough to counter demographic inflation (aging workforce). If this index accelerates, it implies a productivity boom that justifies higher stock valuations even with higher interest rates.\", \"quant\": \"The correlation between this index and NASDAQ-100 earnings growth is 0.92 with a 3-month lead. Our models show that for every $1 of cloud spend, $5 of enterprise value is created downstream—until the ratio breaks.\", \"technical\": \"The chart is parabolic. In classical Technical Analysis, parabolas always resolve in a 'Blow-off Top' or a 'Plateau'. We are watching for a 'Double Top' in GPU lead times as the first sign of saturation.\", \"policy\": \"Antitrust is the biggest risk. Governments fear 'Digital God' monopolies. Breaking up Big Tech could temporarily freeze investment, crashing the index even if organic demand exists.\", \"tech\": \"We are shifting from 'Training' (Capital Intensive) to 'Inference' (Utility). The explosion of 'Agentic Algorithmic Intelligence' (Algorithmic Intelligence doing work on its own) will require 100x more inference compute than human chatbots. The demand curve is not linear; it is exponential.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The downside risk is 'Power Constraint'—we have the chips, but not the electricity to run them. The upside risk is AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) emerging sooner than expected, rendering all current economic models obsolete.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Bullish, but monitor for 'Capex Indigestion'. As long as this index is making new highs, stay long semiconductor and energy stocks. If it rolls over, move to cash immediately."
