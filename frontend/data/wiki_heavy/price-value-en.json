        "summary": "This maxim, a favorite of Warren Buffett, distinguishes between the market's noise (price) and the asset's reality (value). Price is arbitrary, fluctuating wildly based on emotion. Value is fundamental, based on cash flows and assets. The successful investor exploits the gap between the two.",
        "deep_dive": "The Efficient Market Hypothesis claims Price = Value always. We disagree. Price oscillates around Value like a pendulum. Sometimes it swings way too high (Euphoria), sometimes way too low (Panic). The goal is to buy when Price < Value and sell when Price > Value. To do this, you must be able to estimate Value independently of Price.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Geopolitical Arbitrage. We look for nations where the 'Price' (risk premium/yield) is high because of perceived instability, but the 'Value' (fundamentals/resources) is solid. When the perception of risk drops, Price rises to meet Value. Vietnam was a classic example in the early 2010s.\", \"macro\": \"Currency Misalignment. We trade currencies where the market price deviates from purchasing power parity (PPP) or real effective exchange rates (REER). If a currency is 30% undervalued by PPP (Price < Value), we go long and wait for the gap to close.\", \"quant\": \"Value Factor. We systematically buy stocks with low Price-to-Book or Price-to-Earnings ratios. Historically, buying 'cheap' assets (Price < Value) outperforms buying 'expensive' assets. The 'Value Premium' is one of the most robust anomalies in finance.\", \"technical\": \"Mean Reversion. Price tends to revert to the mean (Value). Bollinger Bands and Moving Averages help us visualize how far Price has stretched from its trend (a proxy for Value). When Price is 3 standard deviations away from the mean, it is likely to snap back.\", \"policy\": \"Policy Discounts. Markets often overreact to policy threats (e.g., antitrust fears). This depresses Price below Value. If the actual policy outcome is benign, the stock rallies. We buy the fear and sell the relief.\", \"tech\": \"Adoption vs. Hype. In tech bubbles, Price disconnects from Value (Dotcom crash). In tech depressions, Price falls below Value (Amazon in 2001). We look for companies where the 'Value' (user growth/retention) is compounding, even if the 'Price' (stock) is stalled.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Value Traps. The biggest risk is that you are wrong about Value. You think a stock is cheap (Price $10, Value $20), but the business is actually dying (True Value $5). If Price falls to $5, you didn't buy a bargain; you bought a trap. 'Cheap' does not always mean 'Value'.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Focus on the business (Value), not the ticker (Price). If the business does well, the stock eventually follows."
