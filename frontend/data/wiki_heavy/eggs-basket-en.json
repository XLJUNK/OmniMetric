        "summary": "The first rule of risk management: Diversification. No matter how confident you are in a single investment, you can be wrong. 'Black Swans' happen. Spreading your capital across different assets, sectors, and geographies ensures that a single failure does not wipe you out.",
        "deep_dive": "This is the only 'Free Lunch' in finance. Nobel Prize winner Harry Markowitz proved that by combining uncorrelated assets, you can reduce portfolio risk without reducing expected returns. Diversification improves the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio).",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Jurisdictional Diversification. Never have all your wealth in one country. If you live in China, own US stocks. If you live in the US, own emerging markets or gold. Political risk is binary. Diversification protects you from your own government.\", \"macro\": \"Asset Class Diversification. Stocks, Bonds, Commodities, Crypto. In 2022, both Stocks and Bonds fell together (Correlation = 1). You needed Commodities (Oil/Gold) to survive. True diversification requires assets that react differently to inflation and growth shocks.\", \"quant\": \"Correlation Matrices. We calculate the correlation coefficient between every asset in the portfolio. If everything moves up and down together (Correlation > 0.8), you are not diversified; you are just leveraged. We want uncorrelated bets.\", \"technical\": \"Sector Rotation. Money rotates. Technology leads, then Energy, then Utilities. If you are 100% in Tech, you suffer massive drawdowns during rotation. Being in multiple sectors smoothes the equity curve.\", \"policy\": \"Tax Diversification. Have money in taxable accounts, tax-deferred accounts (401k), and tax-free accounts (Roth). Legislative risk means tax rates can change. Diversifying account types protects you from future tax hikes.\", \"tech\": \"Platform Dependency. Don't build your entire business on one platform (e.g., Facebook Ads or Amazon FBA). If they change the algorithm, you die. Diversify your traffic sources and revenue streams. Own your audience.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Di-worsification. Over-diversifying to the point where you own 'the market' and cannot generate alpha. Warren Buffett says, 'Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing.' Concentration builds wealth; diversification preserves it.",
        "gms_conclusion": "For 99% of people, diversification is survival. Concentrate to get rich, diversify to stay rich."
