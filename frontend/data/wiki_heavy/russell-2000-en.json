        "summary": "The Russell 2000 follows the performance of 2,000 small-cap US companies. It is the definitive gauge for the US domestic economy's health, as these firms are less reliant on global exports than their large-cap counterparts.",
        "deep_dive": "Small-caps are the most sensitive to the 'Domestic Pulse'. Unlike the tech-heavy S&P 500, the Russell 2000 is dominated by regional banks, industrial manufacturers, and service providers. In 2026, the index remains highly levered to interest rate expectations. Small caps typically have higher debt-to-equity ratios and shorter-duration debt, making them the 'Canary in the Coal Mine' for credit tightening cycles. A breakout in the Russell 2000 often signals a broadening of market breadth beyond the 'Magnificent 7'.",
        "council_debate": {
            "geopolitics": "Relatively insulated from global trade wars. If the US shifts towards protectionism and 'Onshoring', the Russell 2000 outshines large exporters.",
            "macro": "The ultimate proxy for US GDP and domestic consumer strength. When domestic liquidity is high and regional banks are healthy, the Russell 2000 thrives.",
            "quant": "We track the 'Debt Refinancing Wall'. Small-cap earnings are vulnerable to 'Higher for Longer' rates as their cost of capital remains sticky.",
            "technical": "Watch the 2200 level. It has served as a structural ceiling. A clean break above indicates a rotation into 'Main Street' stocks from 'Wall Street' giants.",
            "policy": "Sensitive to corporate tax policy and labor market regulations. Small businesses feel the regulatory 'Sand in the Gears' much faster than multinationals.",
            "tech": "While lagging in the AI race, 'Secondary AI' integration—using AI for operational efficiency rather than selling it—is the growth story here."
        },
        "forecast_risks": "Risk of a 'Zombie Apocalypse' where rising interest rates force mass defaults among small-cap firms that can no longer service their debt.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The vital heartbeat of the US Domestic Economy. Highly volatile, but indispensable for timing market rotations."
