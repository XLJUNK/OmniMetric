        "summary": "Ethereum is not just money; it is a global, decentralized computer. It powers the ecosystem of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Tokenization. It is the fuel (Gas) for the Web3 economy.",
        "deep_dive": "Following 'The Merge', Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake, reducing energy consumption by 99% and becoming a yield-bearing asset. With the EIP-1559 implementation, it now has deflationary mechanics (burning supply) during periods of high activity ('Ultrasound Money').",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"While Bitcoin is 'Separate Money and State', Ethereum is 'Separate Law and State'. Smart Contracts execute indiscriminately, creating a neutral system for global commerce and agreements.\", \"macro\": \"Ethereum is the App Store of crypto. If you are bullish on the concept of 'Tokenization of Real World Assets' (stocks, bonds, real estate on-chain), you are structurally long ETH.\", \"quant\": \"We value ETH using a DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) model based on gas fees. It is the only crypto asset with significant, recurring revenue ($2B+ per year) that can be valued like a tech growth stock + dividend.\", \"technical\": \"The ETH/BTC ratio is the primary gauge of 'Risk-On' in crypto. When ETH outperforms BTC, it signals an 'Altseason'. Currently, the ratio is near multi-year lows, suggesting potential value.\", \"policy\": \"The SEC has effectively conceded that ETH is a commodity, not a security, via ETF approvals. However, regulatory clarity on 'Staking' services remains a gray area.\", \"tech\": \"Scalability is the bottleneck. The roadmap relies on 'Layer 2' solutions (Optimism, Arbitrum, Base). The risk is liquidity fragmentation across these L2s, breaking the atomic composability that makes DeFi powerful.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Competition. Solana offers higher speed and lower costs, challenging Ethereum's dominance. If Ethereum becomes the 'Boomer Chain' (too expensive/slow), it could lose the next generation of developers.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The internet bond of the future. Essential infrastructure play. Hold for yield and utility."
