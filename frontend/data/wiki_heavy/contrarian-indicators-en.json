        "summary": "The Headline Indicator. When a financial trend hits the cover of a mainstream magazine (Time, The Economist, Forbes), the trend is exhausted. It signals that the 'Crowd' has finally capitulated and entered the trade, leaving no one left to buy.",
        "deep_dive": "Famous concept popularized by Paul Macrae Montgomery. It works because mainstream journalists only cover a trend when it becomes 'Undeniable'. By definition, a trend that is undeniable is already fully priced in. The 'Cover Curse' often marks the exact top (or bottom) within weeks.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"We watch the 'Consensus Narrative'. When every major outlet agrees on a geopolitical outcome (e.g., 'Russia will collapse in 3 months'), the opposite usually happens. The 'Establishment View' is a lagging indicator of reality because it is filtered through groupthink.\", \"macro\": \"The 'Death of Equities' (BusinessWeek 1979) marked the bottom of the stock market. The 'King Cash' cover marked the top of the Dollar. We use these covers as 'Sentiment Extremes'. When everyone is bearish, we buy. When everyone is bullish, we sell.\", \"quant\": \"We can quantify 'Media Sentiment'. We scrape headlines and assign 'Sentiment Scores'. When the 30-day moving average of sentiment hits +2 standard deviations, we short. algorithmic contrarianism outperforms human intuition because it removes the fear of fighting the crowd.\", \"technical\": \"Volume Spikes match the Magazine Cover. The cover story coincides with the highest volume week of the year (Climax Top). This is the 'Handover' from the smart money (who bought 2 years ago) to the public (who just read the magazine).\", \"policy\": \"Regulation often marks the top. When Congress holds hearings on 'How wonderful Crypto is', it's a top. When they hold hearings to 'Ban Bitcoin', it's a bottom. Politicians are the ultimate lagging indicator because they react to constituent anger/euphoria.\", \"tech\": \"The 'New Era' fallacy. When a tech CEO is named 'Person of the Year' (Jeff Bezos 1999, Elon Musk 2021), it is often the peak of that tech cycle. The glory comes at the end, not the beginning.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The 'Rational' Delay. Sometimes the crowd is right for a while longer. 'The Economist' predicted the fall of the Dollar in 2004, but it rallied for another year. Being a contrarian requires deep pockets to withstand the final 'Blow-off Top' phase.",
        "gms_conclusion": "When the shoeshine boy gives you stock tips, sell. When the magazine cover says 'End of the World', buy."
