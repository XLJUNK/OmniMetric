        "deep_dive": "Momentum is the most powerful 'Factor' in finance. In 2026, the SPY Momentum indicator tells us if the market is in a 'Calculated Bull Run' or a 'Parabolic Speculative Blow-off'. When momentum is high and rising, the 'Trend is your Friend'. However, when momentum starts to fall while the price makes a new high (Momentum Divergence), it is a signal that the 'Liquidators' are moving in. For macro traders, this is the ultimate 'Timing' tool. It prevents you from 'Fighting the Tape' during a rally but warns you to 'Exit Early' before the crash starts. It is the purest measure of investor psychology and animal spirits.",
