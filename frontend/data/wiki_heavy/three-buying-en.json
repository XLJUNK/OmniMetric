        "summary": "This maxim advises against going 'all in' at once. The prudent investor buys a position in three parts: a pilot position to test the waters, a main addition when the thesis is confirmed (e.g., successful support retest), and a final addition when the trend is fully established. This manages risk and average cost.",
        "deep_dive": "Market timing is imperfect. If you buy your full size at once and the trade goes against you, you are paralyzed by the loss. If you scale in, a drop is an opportunity to buy the second third at a better price (if the thesis holds), or a cheap lesson if you cut the pilot position.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Event Risk. Geopolitical events unfold in stages. We don't bet the farm on Day 1 of a crisis. We deploy capital as clarity improves (e.g., waiting for the initial shock of a conflict to pass before buying defense stocks).\", \"macro\": \"Cycle Turns. Macro turning points are messy. Predicting the exact bottom of a recession is impossible. We buy the 'first third' when valuation improves, the 'second third' when leading indicators turn, and the 'final third' when realized data improves.\", \"quant\": \"Volatility Targeting. We size positions based on volatility. As volatility drops (which often happens as a trend stabilizes), we can increase size while maintaining the same risk contribution. Scaling in allows us to adjust to changing market volatility.\", \"technical\": \"Pyramiding. The classic trend follower's technique. Buy at the breakout. Buy more at the first pullback/consolidation. Buy the last piece at the next breakout. You are 'averaging up', which means you are only adding to winning trades.\", \"policy\": \"Regulatory Clarity. When a new regulation is proposed, we take a small stake in the affected sector. When the draft is released, we add. When the law passes, we complete the position. We pay for certainty.\", \"tech\": \"Venture Staging. VCs never give a startup all the money upfront. They give Seed funding (1/3), Series A (1/3), and Series B (1/3). Each tranche requires hitting milestones. Public market investors should treat their positions the same way.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Averaging Down. The danger of scaling in is 'averaging down' into a loser without a stop loss. The second and third buys should ideally be at *higher* prices (adding to a winner) or strictly defined support levels. Adding to a collapsing knife is not scaling; it's suicide.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The market is not a casino where you put it all on Red. It is a campaign. Deploy your troops in waves, not all at once."
