        "summary": "This maxim emphasizes timing and patience. Just as you cannot force a fruit to ripen by pulling on it, you cannot force a market to give you a profit. You must wait for the setup to fully develop. Entering too early (anticipating) is often as dangerous as entering too late.",
        "deep_dive": "Premature entry is a common sin. A trader sees a pattern forming and enters before the breakout, hoping to get a better price. But the pattern fails. The professional waits for the trigger. The 'ripe' opportunity is one where the probability has shifted decisively in your favor.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Strategic Windows. Nations wait for the right moment to act. A military offensive launched too early fails due to lack of preparation. Launched too late, the surprise is lost. We watch for the 'strategic window' where political will and capability align.\", \"macro\": \"Cycle Maturity. We don't short a bubble just because it's expensive (unripe). We wait for the catalyst that pricks it (ripe). Valuation tells you *what* to trade; cycle analysis tells you *when*. We wait for the central bank to blink.\", \"quant\": \"Convergence. In arbitrage, we wait for the spread to widen to a statistical extreme (ripe) before entering. Entering when the spread is narrow offers poor risk/reward. We need the 'dislocation' to be wide enough to justify the capital.\", \"technical\": \"Candle Confirmation. A doji candle signals indecision (unripe). A strong engulfing candle following the doji signals the decision has been made (ripe). We wait for the close of the candle. An unclosed candle is a lie.\", \"policy\": \"Implementation Rules. A law is passed (unripe). The agency writes the detailed rules (ripening). The rules are enforced and money flows (ripe). We invest when the regulatory framework is actionable, not just theoretical.\", \"tech\": \"Commercial Viability. Technology often exists for decades before it is profitable (e.g., Electric Vehicles). We wait for the cost curve to drop and infrastructure to build out. We invest when the tech is 'commercial', not just 'experimental'.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Rotting on the Vine. The risk is 'Analysis Paralysis'. If you wait for *perfect* confirmation, the opportunity may pass you by. The fruit is ripe for a short time. You must hesitate to enter, but strike without hesitation when the signal fires.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The market is a garden, not a factory. You cannot manufacture returns. You can only harvest them when they are ready."
