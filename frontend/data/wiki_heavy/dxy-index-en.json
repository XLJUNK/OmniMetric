        "summary": "The DXY measures the value of the US Dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies (Euro, Yen, Pound, etc.). It acts as the 'Wrecking Ball' for global asset/risk prices.",
        "deep_dive": "When DXY rises, global liquidity tightens. Emerging markets suffer (dollar-denominated debt gets harder to pay), commodities fall (priced in dollars), and US corporate earnings (multinationals) take a hit due to currency conversion.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"The weaponization of the dollar (sanctions) is driving BRICS nations to trade in local currencies. Long term, this weakens the structural bid for USD. Short term, in a crisis, everyone still runs to the dollar.\", \"macro\": \"The 'Dollar Smile Theory': The dollar rises in a US Boom (strong growth) AND in a Global Bust (safety). It falls only when the US muddles along while the Rest of World grows faster.\", \"quant\": \"Strong negative correlation with Bitcoin and Gold. If DXY breaks 105, expect a 10-15% correction in crypto and metals. It is the denominator for everything.\", \"technical\": \"The 100-107 range has been the sandbox. A sustained break above 107 triggers a global margin call. A break below 100 signals the start of the 'Reflation Phase'.\", \"policy\": \"Yellen is engaging in stealth intervention (Treasury buybacks) to keep the dollar from spiking too high, which would break the US bond market. A weaker dollar helps US exports.\", \"tech\": \"Stablecoins (USDT/USDC) are actually extending the dollar's dominance, not replacing it. They are creating a voracious new demand for US T-Bills to back digital dollars.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The 'De-dollarization' tail risk. If Saudi Arabia prices oil in Yuan fully, or if a competing BRICS reserve currency gains traction, the DXY could collapse structurally, causing hyper-inflation in the US (import prices soar).",
        "gms_conclusion": "The ultimate gauge of global stress. If DXY is rising, liquidity is falling. We prefer a DXY trending down toward 98 for a Broad-Based Bull Market."
