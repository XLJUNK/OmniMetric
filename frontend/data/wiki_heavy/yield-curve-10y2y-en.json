        "summary": "The 10Y-2Y Yield Curve Spread is the difference between the 10-year Treasury yield and the 2-year Treasury yield. It is the most reliable recession predictor in history. When it 'inverts' (falls below 0%), it signals a coming recession. When it 'un-inverts' back to positive territory, the recession usually begins immediately.",
        "deep_dive": "An inverted curve means short-term rates (controlled by the Fed) are higher than long-term rates (controlled by growth expectations), implying the Fed is 'breaking' the economy to fight inflation. The dangerous phase is not the inversion, but the 're-steepening' just before the crash.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Foreign central banks (China, Japan) selling US Treasuries impacts the long end (10Y) more than the short end (2Y). This structural selling pressure can steepen the curve artificially, giving a false 'growth' signal when it's actually a liquidity exit.\", \"macro\": \"Watch the 'Bear Steepener' vs. 'Bull Steepener'. A Bull Steepener (2Y falls faster than 10Y) means the Fed is panic-cutting rates—that's recessionary. A Bear Steepener (10Y rises faster than 2Y) means inflation is re-accelerating—that's destructive for valuations.\", \"quant\": \"The 'Lead Time' from inversion to recession varies (6 to 24 months), but the signal has a 100% hit rate since 1955. My models trigger a 'Red Alert' when the curve un-inverts after being inverted for >3 months.\", \"technical\": \"The Zero Line (0.00%) is the critical level. We often see a 'Kiss Goodnight' where the spread rallies to test 0.00% from below, gets rejected, and then crashes lower before the final breakout. Once it sustains >15bps positive, the equity drawdown usually accelerates.\", \"policy\": \"The Fed hates the inverted curve because it destroys bank business models (borrow short, lend long). They will try to manipulate the long end via 'Operation Twist' or QT adjustments to force a normal curve, potentially masking organic signals.\", \"tech\": \"Algorithmic Intelligence deflation should theoretically drag the 10Y yield down permanently (tech-driven cost collapse), flattening the curve structurally. If the 10Y stays high despite Algorithmic Intelligence, it proves fiscal dominance (debt supply) matters more than productivity growth.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Risk of 'Fiscal Dominance' preventing the 10Y from falling, keeping the curve inverted for years without a recession ('Godot Recession'). Upside risk is a rapid normalization driven by a productivity boom, validating a 'Soft Landing'.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Extreme Caution. If the curve is inverted, you are on borrowed time. If the curve is rapidly steepening from negative to positive, the window to exit risk assets is closing."
