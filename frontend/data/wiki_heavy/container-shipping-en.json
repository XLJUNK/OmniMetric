        "deep_dive": "In 2026, Container Shipping is the primary indicator for the 'Global Consumer'. While the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) tracks raw materials, Container Shipping tracks the actual products—iPhones, TVs, and Sneakers. The sector is hyper-sensitive to global trade friction and chokepoint disruptions (Suez/Panama). After the massive volatility of the 2021-2024 period, the sector has stabilized but remains at higher price levels due to 'Slow Steaming' and 'Environmental Surcharges'. For macro traders, a rise in container rates is the earliest signal of 'Imported Inflation' for Western retailers. It is a 'High-Volatility' cyclical play on global trade flows.",
