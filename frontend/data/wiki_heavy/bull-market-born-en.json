        "summary": "Templeton's Cycle. 'Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria.' You must identify where we are in this emotional life cycle. The point of maximum financial opportunity is the point of maximum pessimism.",
        "deep_dive": "Sir John Templeton's 4 stages of a market cycle. This framework helps investors ignore the news and focus on sentiment. If the news is bad but the market is rising, we are in the 'Skepticism' phase (Growth). If the news is great and everyone is buying, we are in 'Euphoria' (Death).",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Pessimism is often geopolitical. The Cold War, the 1970s Oil Crisis, the 2008 GFC. These periods of extreme pessimism birthed the greatest bull markets in history. We look for 'Despair' in the headlines as a buy signal.\", \"macro\": \"Recessions birth Bull Markets. The stock market is a leading indicator. It bottoms *before* the economy improves. If you wait for the economy to look good (Optimism), you have missed the first 50% of the rally (born on Pessimism).\", \"quant\": \"Sentiment Indicators. We quantify Templeton's stages. AAII Bear Sentiment > 50% = Pessimism (Buy). Consumer Confidence at all-time lows = Pessimism (Buy). Record high margin debt = Euphoria (Sell). We trade the emotion, not the earnings.\", \"technical\": \"Stage Analysis. Weinstein's Stage 1 (Basing) happens during Pessimism. Stage 2 (Advancing) happens during Skepticism/Optimism. Stage 3 (Topping) happens during Euphoria. We buy the breakout from Stage 1 into Stage 2.\", \"policy\": \"Pessimism forces Policy. When pessimism is high, politicians panic and print money (Stimulus). Bull markets are born on the liquidity created to fight the pessimism. We don't fight the Fed; we buy their panic.\", \"tech\": \"Disillusionment. The 'Trough of Disillusionment' in the Gartner Hype Cycle corresponds to Templeton's Pessimism. After the initial bubble bursts (AI, Dotcom), the real bull market begins when everyone hates the technology. That is when the real winners emerge.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The 'Hope' Trap. Sometimes pessimism is just realism. Japan in 1989. The pessimism was justified for 30 years. You need a catalyst (Policy or Tech) to birth the bull market, otherwise, pessimism just stays pessimism.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Counter-intuitive investing. If it feels scary to buy, it's probably the right time. If it feels safe and easy, it's probably the top."
