        "summary": "The CPI tracks the weighted average price of a basket of consumer goods and services, serving as the benchmark for inflation. The Fed targets 2%, but in the post-COVID world, 'Supercore CPI' (Services excluding Energy and Housing) has become the real battleground.",
        "deep_dive": "Traditional CPI is lagging. Housing (Shelter) makes up ~34% of the index but trails real-time rent data by 12 months. In 2026, the focus is on 'AI-flation' (rising cost of compute/energy) versus 'AI-deflation' (collapsing cost of cognitive labor).",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Deglobalization is inflationary. Reshoring supply chains adds a structural 1-2% rigid cost to CPI that monetary policy cannot fix.\", \"macro\": \"The 'Last Mile' of inflation is the hardest. Getting from 9% to 3% was easy (supply chains healing). Getting from 3% to 2% requires crushing demand, which the Fed is hesitant to do in an election cycle.\", \"quant\": \"Statistical arbitrage opportunity exists in forecasting the 'Owners' Equivalent Rent' (OER) component. Current lag models predict a sharp drop in OER, which should pull headline CPI below 2% temporarily, creating a 'Headfake' rally.\", \"technical\": \"CPI release days are the new earnings days. Intraday volatility spikes 300% on release. The chart pattern suggests a 'higher floor' for inflation, around 2.5-3.0% long term.\", \"policy\": \"The Fed is secretly accepting 3% as the new 2%. They won't say it, but their actions (pausing rates despite sticky services inflation) confirm 'Opportunistic Disinflation' is the strategy.\", \"tech\": \"Technology is the ultimate deflationary force. If AI agents reduce the cost of coding, legal, and admin tasks to near zero, heavily weighted service components of CPI will collapse, masking inflation in physical goods.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Risk of 'Stagflation Lite' where growth slows but CPI sticks at 3.5% due to wage spiraling. Upside risk (for markets, not consumers) is AI productivity driving CPI to 0% despite massive money printing.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Neutral View. The components are mixed. Ignore the headline number; focus on Supercore Month-over-Month. If Supercore annualizes >3.5%, remain defensive."
