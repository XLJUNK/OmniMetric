        "summary": "This maxim warns against Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). When a price spikes vertically, it is often a 'bull trap' or a short squeeze. The smart investor waits for the inevitable profit-taking pullback to enter at a better risk/reward ratio. Rising prices attract amateurs; falling prices attract professionals.",
        "deep_dive": "Markets move in waves, not straight lines. A vertical move (parabolic) is unsustainable because buyers exhaust their ammunition. Chasing a spike means your stop-loss has to be very wide, ruining your risk management. Waiting for a 'flag' or 'retracement' allows for a tight stop.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Headline Risk. A sudden spike in oil or gold due to a geopolitical headline is often a 'fade'. The initial reaction is pure panic. As the reality sets in (disruptions are rarely as bad as feared), the premium evaporates. We sell the spike.\", \"macro\": \"Data Noise. A sudden rise in yields after a single CPI print can be a head-fake. Macrotrends turn slowly like an aircraft carrier. A 4% move in a day is usually noise or a liquidity event, not a change in the fundamental cycle.\", \"quant\": \"Mean Reversion. Prices often overshoot their fair value in the short term. Statistical models look for 'extension' away from the moving average (Z-score > 3). At these levels, the probability of a reversal is mathematically higher than continuation. We short the extension.\", \"technical\": \"Exhaustion Gaps. A sudden rise at the end of a trend is often an 'Exhaustion Gap'. Everyone who wanted to buy has finally capitulated and bought. There is no one left to push the price higher. This is a classic top signal.\", \"policy\": \"Knee-Jerk Reactions. Markets often spike on a policy rumor (e.g., 'China stimulus'). Unless the policy is backed by concrete liquidity injections, the rally will fail. We wait for the specifics (the blue book) before chasing the green candle.\", \"tech\": \"Hype Cycle Peak. A sudden rise in a crypto token or Algorithmic Intelligence stock usually marks the 'Peak of Inflated Expectations'. The underlying tech takes years to mature. Buying the vertical vertical spike guarantees years of bag-holding (e.g., 2021 tech tops).\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Running Away. Sometimes, the market *does* move in a straight line (e.g., a true paradigm shift or hyperinflation). If you wait for a pullback that never comes, you miss the trade. The solution is to use a 'Breakout Entry' for a small size, but never chase a *extended* move.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Patience pays. The market will always offer you a second chance (the retest). If it doesn't, let it go. There are always other busses."
