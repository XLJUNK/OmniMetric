        "summary": "This maxim asserts that technical skills (chart reading, financial modeling) are secondary to emotional control. The best strategy in the world will fail if the trader cannot execute it due to fear, greed, or impatience. Success comes from mastering oneself, not just mastering the market.",
        "deep_dive": "The market is designed to trigger your primitive 'fight or flight' instincts. When you lose money, your brain feels physical pain. When you make money, it feels euphoria. These emotions lead to bad decisions (selling at the bottom, buying at the top). The 90% is the discipline to override biology.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"National Will. In war, the psychological state of the population (morale) is often more decisive than the number of tanks. A nation that loses the will to fight has already lost. We assess not just military capability, but 'national psychology'.\", \"macro\": \"Consumer Confidence. The economy is driven by psychology. If consumers *believe* a recession is coming, they stop spending, and a recession happens. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy. We track 'confidence' metrics as leading indicators of GDP.\", \"quant\": \"Behavioral Finance. Markets are not efficient; they are behavioral. Anomalies like the 'January Effect' or 'Momentum' exist because humans are irrational. Our algos do not traded stocks; they trade human errors.\", \"technical\": \"Support is Belief. A support level holds not because of magic, but because enough traders *believe* it will hold. It is a psychological barrier. When the belief breaks, the level breaks. We watch for the 'crack' in the psychological wall.\", \"policy\": \" Credibility. A central bank's power comes from its credibility (psychology). If the market believes the Fed will fight inflation, it doesn't even need to raise rates. The 'Forward Guidance' is a psychological weapon.\", \"tech\": \"Adoption curves. Technology adoption is psychological. It requires users to change their behavior. The 'Chasm' between early adopters and the early majority is a psychological hurdle. We invest in companies that have proven they can change user psychology (e.g., iPhone).\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Overconfidence. The biggest psychological risk is thinking you have mastered psychology. The moment you think 'I am immune to emotion', you are most vulnerable. Humility is the only hedge against hubris.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The enemy is in the mirror. Master your mind, and the market will surrender its wealth."
