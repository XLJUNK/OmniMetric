        "summary": "This maxim, championed by Charlie Munger, is a powerful mental model for solving complex problems. Instead of asking 'How can I succeed?', ask 'How can I fail?' and avoid those things. In investing, instead of asking 'What makes a great stock?', ask 'What makes a terrible stock?' (high debt, declining sales, bad management) and screen them out.",
        "deep_dive": "Algebra problems are often easier to solve by inversion. Life problems are too. Munger said, 'All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there.' By identifying and avoiding stupidity, you don't have to be brilliant. You just have to be consistently not stupid.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Inverted Stability. Instead of asking 'What makes a country stable?', ask 'What causes a revolution?' (food inflation, youth unemployment, corruption). We short countries with these characteristics before the revolution happens. We don't predict peace; we predict chaos and profit from the breakdown.\", \"macro\": \"Inverted Growth. Instead of asking 'What drives growth?', ask 'What kills growth?' (high taxes, excessive regulation, debt overhang). We avoid economies that are actively killing their own growth engines. We look for the absence of headwinds, not just the presence of tailwinds.\", \"quant\": \"Inverted Screening. Most quants screen for the 'best' stocks (Top 10%). We invert and screen out the 'worst' stocks (Bottom 10% - the 'Junk'). By simply removing the bottom decile (fraud, impending bankruptcy) from the universe, the performance of the remaining portfolio improves dramatically.\", \"technical\": \"Inverted Charts. Sometimes we flip the chart upside down (Invert scale). A 'buy the dip' pattern in a downtrend looks like a 'sell the rip' pattern in an uptrend. Inversion helps remove bullish bias and allows us to see the structure of the market more objectively.\", \"policy\": \"Inverted Incentives. We look for 'Perverse Incentives'—policies that achieve the opposite of their intent (e.g., rent control reducing housing supply). When we see a policy with inverted incentives, we bet on the failure of that policy.\", \"tech\": \"Inverted Innovation. Instead of asking 'What will change?', Jeff Bezos asks 'What will NOT change in the next 10 years?' (customers wanting low prices and fast delivery). We invest in the things that will not change, because we can build a business around them.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Paralysis by Analysis. Inversion is a filter, not a motor. If you only look for reasons to say 'No', you will say 'No' to everything. You will avoid all failure, but you will also miss all success. Inversion must be paired with conviction. You first delete the bad, then you must aggressively buy the good.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The road to success is paved by avoiding the ditches."
