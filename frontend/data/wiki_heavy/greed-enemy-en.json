        "summary": "This maxim warns that the greatest threat to a trader is not the market, but their own psychology. Greed manifests as holding a winning position too long (hoping for a home run), over-leveraging (hoping for quick riches), or chasing price. The market has no emotions; your emotions are your liability.",
        "deep_dive": "Greed blinds you to risk. When you are winning, dopamine floods your brain, making you feel invincible. You ignore sell signals. You double down. This state of 'irrational exuberance' is usually the top. To defeat greed, you must have a mechanical exit strategy.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Imperial Overstretch. Nations often fall due to greed for territory. They expand beyond their defensible borders (over-leveraging). The cost of occupation exceeds the value of the conquest. We short empires that are overextended and buy those that are consolidating.\", \"macro\": \"Yield Chasing. In a low-yield environment, investors get greedy and move out on the risk curve (junk bonds, EM debt) to get yield. They forget that high yield = high risk. When the credit cycle turns, these greedy positions get wiped out first.\", \"quant\": \"Overfitting. A greedy quant tries to extract every last pip of profit from historical data. They build a complex model that fits the past perfectly (100% win rate). But in the real world (out-of-sample), the model fails because it learned the noise, not the signal. We prefer robust, simple models.\", \"technical\": \"Target Extensions. Greed is waiting for the 1.618 Fibonacci extension when the price is stalling at the 1.272. It is trying to catch the exact top. The disciplined trader takes profit at the first target and leaves the rest for the 'greater fool'.\", \"policy\": \"Lobbying excesses. Corporations get greedy and lobby for too much protection/subsidy. This triggers a populist backlash and regulation that destroys them. We avoid sectors that have become 'too greedy' in their political influence.\", \"tech\": \"Feature Creep. Software projects fail because product managers get greedy and want 'one more feature'. The release is delayed, bugs multiply, and the competitor launches a simple MVP and wins. We invest in companies that ship.\", \"psychology\": \"The Endowment Effect. Greed makes you value what you own more than it's worth. You refuse to sell at fair value because 'it's my winner'. You only sell when fear replaces greed, usually at the bottom.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Fear of Profit. The opposite of greed is not prudence, but fear. If you are so afraid of greed that you take profit too early (tick-snatching), you will never build wealth. You must balance greed (letting winners run) with discipline (trailing stops).",
        "gms_conclusion": "Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. Leave the last 10% for the next guy."
