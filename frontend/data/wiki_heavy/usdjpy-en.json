        "summary": "The 'Widowmaker'. This pair represents the exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Japanese Yen. It is the world's primary indicator for the 'Carry Trade'.",
        "deep_dive": "USD/JPY is the most rate-sensitive pair in the world. It tracks the difference between US 10-Year yields and Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields almost perfectly. In 2026, the story is the 'Great Unwind'. After 20 years of near-zero rates, the Bank of Japan is finally allowing yields to rise. This is forcing global hedge funds to close their 'Yen Carry Trades'—where they borrowed Yen for free to buy everything from US Tech to Mexican Pesos. When USD/JPY falls (Yen strengthens), it usually signals a global 'De-risking' event as leverage is removed from the system. For macro traders, USD/JPY is the heartbeat of global liquidity. If it remains stable at high levels (140-150), global markets can stay calm. If it starts to plunge, a systemic liquidation of risk assets is likely underway.",
