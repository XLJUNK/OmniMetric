        "summary": "Great investment opportunities are born from pessimism. When the consensus is bearish, the bad news is already priced in. Buying when everyone else is selling requires courage, but it provides the best risk-adjusted returns because the 'expectations bar' is so low.",
        "deep_dive": "This is the core of Contrarian Investing. If 90% of analysts are bearish, who is left to sell? The selling pressure is exhausted. Any piece of 'less bad' news can trigger a massive short-covering rally. The point of maximum pessimism is the point of maximum financial opportunity.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Crisis Alpha. The best time to buy a country's market is when its geopolitical future looks bleakest (e.g., post-war reconstruction). Prices are distressed, and the risk premium is huge. If the country survives, the returns are exponential.\", \"macro\": \"Recession Bottoms. Markets bottom *during* the recession, not after it. If you wait for the economy to improve, you will buy the top. You must buy when the macro data is terrible but the market stops going down (divergence).\", \"quant\": \"Sentiment Extremes. We track Put/Call ratios and Bull/Bear surveys. When bearish sentiment hits >60% (2 standard deviations), it is a statistically significant 'Buy' signal. The crowd is almost always wrong at extremes.\", \"technical\": \"Capitulation Volume. We look for 'Selling Climax' candles—massive volume spikes with long lower wicks. This signals that the weak hands have puked their positions to the strong hands. This is the bottom.\", \"policy\": \"Central Bank Pivot. Extreme bearishness forces Central Banks to step in (The 'Fed Put'). When the economy breaks, the Fed cuts rates and prints money. Buying the bear market anticipates this policy response.\", \"tech\": \"Disillusionment Trough. In the Gartner Hype Cycle, the best time to buy a tech theme is in the 'Trough of Disillusionment'—after the bubble bursts and everyone says the tech is dead (e.g., Bitcoin in 2018, Internet stocks in 2002).\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Catching a Falling Knife. Sometimes the crowd is right. A 'Value Trap' is a stock that is cheap for a reason (bankruptcy risk). Buying bearishness only works if the fundamental thesis is intact and the asset is simply oversold, not obsolete.",
        "gms_conclusion": "To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are greedily buying requires the greatest fortitude and pays the greatest reward."
