        "summary": "This maxim, popularized by Warren Buffett, challenges the dogma of modern portfolio theory. If you know what you are doing (like Buffett), diversification makes little sense. It dilutes your best ideas. Diversification is a hedge against not knowing which companies will succeed. For the ignorant, it is necessary. For the expert, it is a drag.",
        "deep_dive": "Concentration builds wealth; diversification preserves it. The richest people in the world (Gates, Bezos, Musk) did not get rich by diversifying. They got rich by concentrating all their capital in one basket (their own company) and watching that basket very closely. However, if you are not a founder or an expert, concentration can also destroy wealth.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Alliance Diversification. Nations cannot 'concentrate' on just one ally. They must diversify their partnerships (e.g., India balancing US and Russia) to protect against the 'ignorance' of future shifts in power. Relying on a single hegemon is risky.\", \"macro\": \"Commodity Concentration. Economies that concentrate on one export (e.g., Oil in Saudi Arabia, Copper in Chile) are vulnerable to Dutch Disease and price shocks. Economic diversification is protection against the 'ignorance' of future commodity cycles.\", \"quant\": \"Correlation Trap. Diversification only works if assets are uncorrelated. In a crash, 'correlations go to one'. Everything falls together. Therefore, 'naive diversification' (buying 500 stocks) offers false protection. True diversification requires uncorrelated return streams (e.g., Trend Following, Long Volatility).\", \"technical\": \"Sector Rotation. We don't diversify across all sectors all the time. We concentrate in the strongest sectors (Relative Strength) and avoid the weakest. Why own a lagging utility stock just for 'diversification' when tech is breaking out?\", \"policy\": \"Regulatory Hedges. Regulatory risk is binary. If you are 100% in crypto and the government bans it, you die. Diversifying across jurisdictions (regulatory arbitrage) is protection against the 'ignorance' of future policy moves.\", \"tech\": \"Platform Dependency. If your business relies 100% on Facebook Ads or Google Search, you are not diversified. One algorithm change can kill you. Tech companies must diversify their distribution channels to protect against platform risk.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Diworsification. The risk is 'Diworsification'—adding marginal ideas just to fill a quota. Every new position you add lowers the average quality of your portfolio. If your 10th best idea is worse than your 1st best idea (which it always is), adding it lowers your expected return.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Construct your portfolio based on your conviction level. High conviction = Concentration. Low conviction = Diversification."
