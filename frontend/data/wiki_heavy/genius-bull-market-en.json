        "summary": "This maxim warns against attribution error. When the market is going up, everyone makes money, and everyone thinks they are a genius. True skill is only revealed in a bear market. If you made money because everything went up, you are lucky, not smart.",
        "deep_dive": "A rising tide lifts all boats, even the leaky ones. In a bull market, risk-taking is rewarded, regardless of analysis quality. In a bear market, risk is punished. The 'genius' of the bull market is often the first casualty of the bear market because they confuse beta (market exposure) with alpha (skill).",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Regime Stability. Leaders often confuse their own popularity (brains) with a booming global economy (bull market). When the economy turns, their popularity vanishes. We analyze whether a leader's support is structural or cyclical.\", \"macro\": \"Fiscal Revenue. Governments often assume that the tax windfalls from a boom are permanent. They spend the money on structural programs (Brains). When the boom ends (Bear Market), they are left with a structural deficit. We short the debt of countries that spend cyclical revenue on permanent obligations.\", \"quant\": \"Alpha Decay. Strategies that work in a bull market (e.g., 'buy high beta') stop working in a flat or bear market. We test our algos across all regimes. If a strategy only works in a bull market, it is not a strategy; it is a leveraged bet on beta.\", \"technical\": \"Trend Followers. Trend followers look like geniuses in a bull market. They look like fools in a chopping market. We use filters (ADX) to determine if the 'bull market' condition exists before deploying trend-following logic.\", \"policy\": \"Deregulation. Politicians often claim credit for economic growth that was actually caused by a global credit cycle. They use this 'success' to push for more deregulation. When the cycle turns, the lack of regulation exacerbates the crash.\", \"tech\": \"Adoption vs Bubble. Was the Dotcom boom driven by the 'genius' of the internet, or just a bubble? Both. The internet was real, but the valuations were a bull market illusion. We separate the technology (brains) from the stock price (bull market).\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Imposter Syndrome. The flip side is believing you are just lucky when you *are* skilled. This leads to selling too early. You must objectively measure your performance against a benchmark. If you beat the benchmark in a *down* market, it is brains.",
