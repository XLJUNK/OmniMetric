        "summary": "The Golden Rule of Macro. The Federal Reserve has an infinite balance sheet and the legal monopoly on money creation. When they want asset prices up (QE, rate cuts), prices go up. When they want prices down (QT, rate hikes), prices go down. Resistance is futile.",
        "deep_dive": "This maxim originated from Marty Zweig in 1970. It emphasizes aligning your portfolio with monetary policy. Liquidity is the primary driver of asset prices, trumping earnings, valuation, and geopolitical risks. If the Fed is pumping liquidity, bad news doesn't matter. If the Fed is draining liquidity, good news doesn't matter.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"The Fed is the world's central bank. When the Fed hikes, they export deflation and recession to Emerging Markets (dollar shortage). Fighting the Fed is also fighting the global dollar hegemony. When the Fed pivots, it's often to save the US Treasury market, not the stock market.\", \"macro\": \"Liquidity vs. Solvency. The Fed can fix liquidity crises (2008, 2020) by printing money. They cannot fix solvency crises (bad business models) or supply-side inflation (broken supply chains) without causing pain. The nuance is knowing WHICH battle the Fed is fighting.\", \"quant\": \"We track the 'Fed Liquidity Impulse'. Net Liquidity = Fed Balance Sheet - TGA - RRP. When this metric is positive, the S&P 500 rises with a 0.85 correlation. We don't listen to speeches; we track the flow of dollars.\", \"technical\": \"The 'Fed Put' strike price. Technical analysts look for the level where the Fed panics. In 2018, it was a 20% drop. In 2020, it was a credit market freeze. We buy when technicals suggest the Fed is about to become 'friendly' again.\", \"policy\": \"Fiscal Dominance challenges this maxim. If the Treasury spends $2 Trillion (fiscal stimulus) while the Fed hikes rates (monetary tightening), who wins? Recently, Fiscal has been fighting the Fed, keeping the economy hotter than the Fed wants.\", \"tech\": \"Crypto is the purest bet on Fed Liquidity. Bitcoin is the 'anti-fiat' asset. It rallies hardest when the Fed debases the currency. 'Don't Fight the Fed' in crypto means 'Buy when the printer goes brrr'.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The Policy Lag. Monetary policy works with 'long and variable lags' (12-18 months). You might be fighting the Fed's *past* actions without realizing it. Also, the Fed makes mistakes. Following them blindly into a policy error (like 'Transitory Inflation') can be costly.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The Fed is the whale in the pool. Swim in their wake, not in their mouth."
