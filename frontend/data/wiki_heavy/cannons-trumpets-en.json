        "summary": "Attributed to Nathan Rothschild, this maxim is the ultimate geopolitical contrarian strategy. 'Cannons' represent conflict, war, and panic—the point of maximum fear and lowest prices. 'Trumpets' represent victory, peace treaties, and celebration—the point of maximum optimism and highest prices.",
        "deep_dive": "The market hates uncertainty, not bad news. The sound of cannons is peak uncertainty. Once the war starts, the outcome becomes a probability, not a mystery. Risk premiums collapse. By the time the trumpets sound (victory), the good news is already fully priced in.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Crisis Investing. We buy when the first missile is fired (Cannons). We do not wait for the peace treaty. The biggest gains are made during the 'Fog of War' when assets are mispriced due to panic. We sell into the 'Reconstruction Rally' (Trumpets).\", \"macro\": \"Recession Troughs. The economic 'cannons' are negative GDP prints and rising unemployment. This is when we buy equities. The 'trumpets' are record earnings and full employment. This is when we sell. The economy is not the stock market.\", \"quant\": \"Volatility Targeting. Cannons = High VIX. Trumpets = Low VIX. Our models buy volatility spikes (mean reversion) and sell volatility crushes. We provide liquidity when it is most expensive.\", \"technical\": \"Panic Selling Climaxes. We look for 'Capitulation Candles'—massive volume, wide range down bars (Cannons). This signals the last seller has sold. We sell into 'Blow-off Tops'—parabolic moves on hype (Trumpets).\", \"policy\": \"Regulatory Crackdowns. When the government announces a crackdown on a sector (Cannons), we buy the leaders who can survive. When the government praises a sector and offers subsidies (Trumpets), we worry about saturation and competition.\", \"tech\": \"Disruption Panic. When a new technology 'kills' an old industry (Cannons), the old industry is often oversold. When a new tech is hailed as the savior of humanity (Trumpets), it is a bubble.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Existential Threat. The risk is that the cannons destroy the asset entirely (e.g., confiscation, total war, nationalization). You must ensure the asset can survive the conflict. Buying zero is not a bargain.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Profit is the reward for enduring the noise that others cannot bear."
