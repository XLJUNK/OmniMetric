        "summary": "Mean Reversion is a law of nature. Infinite exponential growth is impossible in a finite system. Every asset bubble assumes 'This time it's different' and that growth will continue forever. It never does. Eventually, gravity (valuation) asserts itself.",
        "deep_dive": "Derived from a German proverb. Financially, it describes the limits of compounding. If Amazon continued growing at its 1999 rate for 20 years, it would be larger than the entire global GDP. Mathematical limits eventually cap growth stocks.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Imperial Overstretch. Empires don't grow to the sky either. Rome, Britain, USSR—all expanded until the cost of maintaining the empire exceeded the wealth extracted from it. We short hegemons when they overextend militarily.\", \"macro\": \"The Law of Large Numbers. It is easy to double revenue from $1M to $2M. It is impossible to double revenue from $1T to $2T quickly. As companies get huge, they become the economy (GDP growth), meaning they can no longer grow *faster* than the economy.\", \"quant\": \"Z-Scores. We measure how far price is from the mean (Standard Deviations). A 3-Sigma move (3 standard deviations) happens 0.3% of the time. When we see a 4 or 5 Sigma move (e.g., Meme Stocks), we short it. The rubber band must snap back.\", \"technical\": \"Parabolic Curves. We look for 'Vertical' price action (90-degree slope). Parabolae always collapse. The steeper the ascent, the faster the descent. We wait for the first 'Lower High' after a parabola to short.\", \"policy\": \"Antitrust. When a company grows too tall, the government chops it down. Standard Oil, AT&T, Microsoft. Government is the ceiling. If a tech giant becomes too powerful, regulation will cap its growth. Trees often get pruned by regulators.\", \"tech\": \"S-Curves. Tech adoption follows an S-Curve. Slow start, explosive vertical growth, then saturation/plateau. Investors often mistake the middle of the S-curve (explosive) for a straight line to infinity. Spotting the plateau (saturation) is key to exiting.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Premature Shorting. 'The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.' Trees don't grow to the sky, but they can grow higher than you think. Shorting a bubble is dangerous. Better to just sell and walk away.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Enjoy the shade while the tree is growing, but don't build your house in its branches. Gravity wins in the end."
