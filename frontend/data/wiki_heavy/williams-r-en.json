        "summary": "The 'Whale Detector'. Williams %R is a momentum oscillator that measures overbought and oversold levels. Unlike RSI, it has no smoothing, making it extremely sensitive to market turning points. It spots the exact moment buying pressure exhausts.",
        "deep_dive": "Developed by Larry Williams. It moves on a scale of 0 to -100. 0 to -20 is Overbought. -80 to -100 is Oversold. The magic of %R is its ability to anticipate price reversals before they show up on the chart.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Crisis trading requires speed. RSI is too slow. Williams %R reacts instantly to geopolitical headlines. If news hits and %R stays pinned above -20, the market is discounting the fear. If it drops, sell immediately.\", \"macro\": \"Macro trends pause, but they rarely reverse instantly. We use Williams %R to enter established macro trends on pullbacks. In a Bull Market, we buy when %R hits -80 (Oversold). In a Bear Market, we short when it hits -20 (Overbought).\", \"quant\": \"Mean Reversion alogos love this signal. We look for 'Failure Swings'. If %R hits -100, bounces, and then fails to break -80 on the next retest, it's a divergence signal. Probability of reversal > 65%.\", \"technical\": \"'The Pop'. When price is trending strongly, %R can stay 'Overbought' (above -20) for weeks. This is not a sell signal; it is a sign of extreme strength. Only sell when %R breaks back BELOW -20.\", \"policy\": \"Fed speak creates noise. Williams %R helps filter it. If Powell speaks and the market drops, but %R holds the -50 midline, the trend is intact. It was just a liquidity flush.\", \"tech\": \"Crypto moves fast. We use normalized Williams %R on 4-hour charts for Bitcoin scalp trading. It catches the local tops of 'Pump and Dump' schemes with frightening accuracy.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The 'Peg'. In a super-trend, Williams %R can get 'pegged' at -0 or -100 for a long time. Selling just because it is 'Overbought' in a strong uptrend is a surefire way to go broke. You need a trigger to exit.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The sensitive nerve ending of the market. Use it to time your entries with precision, but respect the trend."
