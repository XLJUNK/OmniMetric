        "summary": "Twain's Observation. Market cycles are driven by human nature (fear and greed), which never changes. While the specific technology or catalyst changes (Railroads in 1890, Internet in 2000, Algorithmic Intelligence in 2024), the pattern of boom, bubble, and bust remains identical.",
        "deep_dive": "Attributed to Mark Twain. It suggests that while exact price levels or dates won't match, the *structure* of events will. We study financial history not to predict the future perfectly, but to recognize the 'rhyme' scheme of the current market cycle.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Empires rise and fall in rhyming cycles. Ray Dalio's 'Changing World Order' is a study of historical rhymes. The decline of the Dutch Guilder rhymes with the British Pound, which rhymes with the potential decline of the US Dollar. We bet on the rhyme of Imperial Decline.\", \"macro\": \"Inflation Rhymes. The 2020s rhyme with the 1940s (fiscal spending + supply shocks) more than the 1970s (demographics + oil shock). Recognizing the correct historical parallel is the key to macro strategy. If you prepare for the 1970s, you might miss the 1940s outcome (Yield Curve Control).\", \"quant\": \"We use 'Fractal Geometry' to find rhymes. We take the price action of 1929 and overlay it on 2024 to see if the correlation is high. If the 'shape' matches, we assume the outcome might be similar. Algorithms execute these 'Pattern Matching' strategies automatically.\", \"technical\": \"Chart patterns are visual rhymes. A 'Head and Shoulders' top in 1929 looks exactly like a 'Head and Shoulders' top in Bitcoin. The asset class is different; the geometry of human distribution is the same.\", \"policy\": \"Policymakers study history to avoid rhyming with past mistakes. Ben Bernanke studied the Great Depression (1929) to avoid repeating it in 2008. He printed money because the mistake of 1929 was tight money. They try to break the rhyme, but often create a new verse of problems.\", \"tech\": \"Adoption curves rhyme. The adoption of the Smartphone rhymes with the adoption of the Internet. We project Algorithmic Intelligence adoption by overlaying the Mobile Internet curve. The rhyme tells us that 'Infrastructure' (Nvidia) pumps first, then 'Apps' (Software) pump later.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The Sample Size Problem. Financial history is short. We only have ~100 years of reliable data. That's only a few major cycles. Finding a 'rhyme' might just be seeing faces in the clouds (Pareidolia). Every time is different in some unique way.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Listen for the rhythm. If the current market music sounds like 1999, don't dance near the exit."
