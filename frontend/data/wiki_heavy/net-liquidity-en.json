    "summary": "Net Liquidity is the 'fuel' of the modern financial system. Defined as the Fed's Balance Sheet minus the Treasury General Account (TGA) and Reverse Repo (RRP), it represents the actual amount of cash available to banks and investors. Since 2020, its correlation with the S&P 500 has recently surpassed that of earnings or GDP.",
    "deep_dive": "Historically, central banks controlled the economy via interest rates (price of money). In the post-QE era, they control it via the Balance Sheet (quantity of money). In 2026, as the RRP facility drains significantly and TGA volatility increases due to sovereign debt refinancing, Net Liquidity has become the single most critical variable for predicting 'Minsky Moments'. The decoupling between traditional valuations and price action is often explained by this metric.",
    "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"The weaponization of the USD forces foreign central banks to diversify away from Treasuries. This reduces the 'external liquidity' entering the US system, making domestic Net Liquidity metrics even more sensitive to internal fiscal shocks.\", \"macro\": \"We are witnessing a regime shift. The 'Fed Put' has been replaced by the 'Liquidity Put'. As long as Net Liquidity remains stable, recessionary signals from the real economy (like NFP misses) are ignored by asset markets.\", \"quant\": \"My models show the correlation coefficient between Net Liquidity 4-week changes and NASDAQ 100 movement is at 0.85. However, there is a 12-day lag. We are currently in a 'Liquidity Air Pocket' where the data suggests a 5% drawdown is mathematically imminent.\", \"technical\": \"Price action is diverging from the liquidity trend. While Net Liquidity has made lower highs, the S&P 500 made higher highs. This 'bearish divergence' usually resolves with a sharp snap-back in price to meet liquidity.\", \"policy\": \"The Treasury is playing a dangerous game. By issuing short-term bills to drain the RRP instead of long-term bonds, they have artificially propped up liquidity. This 'Stealth QE' is nearing its mathematical limit.\", \"tech\": \"AI capital efficiency is distorting this signal. Companies need less liquidity to generate the same output. The old correlation models might be broken because 'GDP per Liquidity Unit' is skyrocketing in the AI Agent era.\"}",
    "forecast_risks": "The primary risk is a 'TGA Shock' where the Treasury drains massive liquidity to fund emergency conflicts, crashing asset prices overnight. Upside risk involves the Fed ending QT early to cap yields, unleashing a 'Liquidity Tsunami' that fuels a hyper-growth bubble.",
    "gms_conclusion": "Bearish Divergence detected. While the AI productivity utility is real, the liquidity fuel tank is flashing red. We recommend reducing leverage impacting high-beta assets until Net Liquidity re-establishes an uptrend."
