        "summary": "This proprietary OmniMetric indicator measures the 'GDP-per-hour-worked' enhancement attributed specifically to AI adoption. It is the 'Magic Sauce' that allows the economy to grow without overheating (inflation).",
        "deep_dive": "Traditional economic models (Okun's Law, Phillips Curve) are breaking down because they assume linear productivity. AI introduces exponential productivity. We track code commit rates, legal document processing speeds, and automated customer service resolution times to calculate this multiplier.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Nations that restrict AI cross-border data flows (data sovereignty) explain why their productivity lag is widening against the US. It's the new 'Iron Curtain'—the 'Silicon Curtain'.\", \"macro\": \"This is the only thing saving us from the debt crisis. If AI boosts GDP growth to 3-4% real, the debt-to-GDP ratio stabilizes. If this multiplier disappoints, the sovereign debt wall hits us hard.\", \"quant\": \"We've adjusted our terminal value calculations. Companies integrating 'Agentic Workflows' get a higher multiple. We are essentially Long Volatility on human ingenuity.\", \"technical\": \"This isn't a tradable ticker, but it correlates 90% with the Nasdaq 100 / Russell 2000 ratio. When the multiplier rises, Mega-Cap Tech outperforms zombie companies.\", \"policy\": \"Regulators are trying to tax 'Robot Labor'. If a 'Bit Tax' is introduced in 2026, this multiplier gets capped. We are watching the legislative docket closely.\", \"tech\": \"The limiting factor is no longer software, it's energy. Is the grid reliable enough to run the AI inference farms that drive this productivity? That's why we pair this with the 'Copper/Gold Ratio'.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The risk is 'Jevons Paradox'—efficiency leads to MORE consumption of resources (energy), driving inflation up via commodity channels, canceling out the deflationary benefit of cheap labor.",
        "gms_conclusion": "The single most important metric for the 'New Normal'. High real rates are sustainable ONLY if this multiplier remains high. It is the justification for the entire 2026 bull market."
