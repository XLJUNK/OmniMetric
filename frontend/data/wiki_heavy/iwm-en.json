        "summary": "The 'Real Economy' proxy. Tracks 2000 small-cap US companies that are primarily domestic and highly sensitive to local interest rates.",
        "deep_dive": "While the S&P 500 is dominated by global tech, the IWM is dominated by regional banks, local industrials, and retail. It is hyper-sensitive to the 'Cost of Debt' because small companies typically have higher leverage and shorter-dated loans. In 2026, the IWM is the 'Canary in the Coal Mine' for the US consumer. If the IWM outperforms, it signals a broad-based economic expansion. If it lags during a tech rally, it means the 'Breadth' of the market is unhealthy. For macro traders, the IWM is the ultimate play on a 'Domestic Recovery' or a 'Rate Cut Pivot'. When interest rates fall, the IWM typically leads the market higher as interest costs for small firms drop.",
