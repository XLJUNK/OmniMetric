        "summary": "Soros's Principle. Markets hate uncertainty but love flux. 'Flux' is manageable change (volatility). 'Uncertainty' is the inability to calculate risk. You can trade flux; you cannot trade uncertainty. When uncertainty becomes flux, money is made.",
        "deep_dive": "George Soros distinguishes between 'Knightian Uncertainty' (unmeasurable risk) and standard risk. In 2008, the value of MBS was uncertain (nobody knew what they were worth). Once the Fed stepped in, the 'Uncertainty' (Will the system collapse?) turned into 'Flux' (Assets are volatile but have a floor). The transition from Uncertainty to Flux is the buy signal.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Regime Change vs. Policy Shift. A coup is Uncertainty (Sell). A new election is Flux (Hold/Trade). We look for the moment when a geopolitical event moves from 'Chaos' to 'Process'. Even a bad process is better than chaos.\", \"macro\": \"Inflation data. When inflation is spiraling and the Fed is silent, that is Uncertainty (Panic). When the Fed announces a roadmap of hikes, even if it's painful, it becomes Flux (Priced in). Markets rally on the roadmap, not the destination.\", \"quant\": \"We model Volatility. Flux is high volatility (Vega). Uncertainty is undefined volatility. Our models break when correlations go to 1 (Uncertainty). We step aside during structural breaks and re-enter when the correlations normalize (Flux).\", \"technical\": \"Chart structure. Flux respects support/resistance levels. Uncertainty breaks them violently. We look for 'Orderly' selling vs. 'Disorderly' liquidation. Orderly selling is tradable flux.\", \"policy\": \"Regulatory Clarity. Crypto hates 'Regulatory Uncertainty'. It prefers 'Strict Regulation' (Flux) over 'Unknown Regulation' (Uncertainty). A ban is better than a maybe, because you can price a ban (move offshore). You can't price a maybe.\", \"tech\": \"Standards Wars. Betamax vs. VHS or Blue-ray vs. HD-DVD was Uncertainty. Once a standard wins, the market enters Flux (growth and competition within the standard). Invest when the winner emerges, or bet on the infrastructure that supports both.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Mistaking Chaos for Flux. Thinking a structural break is just 'noise'. Buying the dip in Lehman Brothers assumed it was just 'market flux'. It was actually 'existential uncertainty'. Don't trade existential risks.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Wait for the 'Rules of the Game' to be clarified. Once the rules are known, even if they are tough, the uncertainty is gone. Trade the Flux."
