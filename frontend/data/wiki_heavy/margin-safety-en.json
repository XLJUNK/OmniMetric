        "summary": "This maxim, coined by Benjamin Graham and later adopted by Warren Buffett, is the central concept of value investing. It means buying an asset at a significant discount to its intrinsic value. This discount provides a cushion against errors in calculation or unforeseen negative events. It is the engineering equivalent of building a bridge to hold 30,000 lbs but only allowing 10,000 lbs trucks to cross.",
        "deep_dive": "If you think a stock is worth $100 and you buy it at $99, you have no margin of safety. If you are wrong and it is worth $90, you lose money. If you buy it at $60, you can be wrong about the value (it's actually $80) and still make money. The Function of the margin of safety is to render the accurate estimate of the future unnecessary.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Strategic Depth. Nations need a margin of safety in their defense. This is 'strategic depth'—the ability to absorb an attack and still survive. Countries with no strategic depth (e.g., small buffer states) live on a knife's edge. We invest in countries that have geopolitical buffers (geographic, alliances, economic reserves).\", \"macro\": \"Fiscal Space. A government with a 30% Debt-to-GDP ratio has a huge margin of safety. It can borrow to fight a recession. A government with 120% Debt-to-GDP has no margin of safety. One crisis can trigger a default. We avoid sovereigns with no fiscal room for error.\", \"quant\": \"Volatility Buffer. In portfolio construction, we assume correlations will break. We keep cash or hedges (Long Vol) as a margin of safety against a liquidity event. If your model assumes 'normal' volatility, you will blow up during a 'Fat Tail' event.\", \"technical\": \"Support Zones. We don't buy right at the support line. We wait for a confirmation bounce or place stops wide enough to account for a 'false breakout'. The distance between our entry and our stop loss is our technical margin of safety.\", \"policy\": \"Regulatory Moat. A company that operates comfortably *above* regulatory standards has a margin of safety. A company that skirts the edge of the law (e.g., crypto exchanges, aggressive tax avoidance) has none. A slight change in enforcement can destroy them.\", \"tech\": \"Server Capacity. In tech, a site that crashes when traffic doubles has no margin of safety. AWS and Cloudflare are built on the concept of massive excess capacity. We invest in tech infrastructure that can handle 'Black Swan' traffic spikes.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Waiting Forever. The risk of demanding a huge margin of safety is that you never buy anything. In a bull market, great assets rarely trade at a 50% discount. You risk sitting in cash for a decade while the market doubles. You must balance safety with opportunity cost.",
