        "summary": "This allegory, created by Benjamin Graham, personifies the stock market as a manic-depressive business partner named 'Mr. Market'. Every day, he offers to buy your share of the business or sell you his share at a specific price. His mood swings wildly from optimism to pessimism. You are free to ignore him or take advantage of him, but you must never be influenced by him.",
        "deep_dive": "Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you. When he is manic (bull market), he offers high prices; you should sell. When he is depressive (bear market), he offers low prices; you should buy. The mistake most investors make is treating Mr. Market as an advisor rather than a partner.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"The Geopolitical Mr. Market. Global sentiment towards countries swings violently. One day, Brazil remain the 'future of the world' (2010); the next, it is 'ungovernable' (2015). We buy when the geopolitical Mr. Market is depressive about a nation's prospects, provided the fundamentals remain intact.\", \"macro\": \"Liquidity Moods. Mr. Market's mood is largely determined by central bank liquidity. When the Fed prints, Mr. Market is happy (Risk On). When the Fed tightens, Mr. Market is sad (Risk Off). We verify the liquidity cycle to predict Mr. Market's next mood swing.\", \"quant\": \"Sentiment Indicators. We measure Mr. Market's mood using VIX, Put/Call ratios, and Bull/Bear surveys. When 90% of investors are bullish, Mr. Market is manic (Sell Signal). When panic pervades, Mr. Market is depressed (Buy Signal).\", \"technical\": \"Overbought/Oversold. RSI and Stochastic oscillators are essentially 'Mr. Market Mood Meters'. An RSI above 80 means he is irrationally exuberant. An RSI below 20 means he is despondent. We fade the extremes.\", \"policy\": \"Policy Panic. Mr. Market hates uncertainty. When a new regulation is proposed, he often assumes the worst-case scenario and dumps stocks. We analyze the actual text of the law. Often, the reality is far less scary than Mr. Market's nightmare, creating a buying opportunity.\", \"tech\": \"Hype Cycles. Gartner's Hype Cycle is a map of Mr. Market's mood regarding technology. From the 'Peak of Inflated Expectations' (Algorithmic Intelligence today?) to the 'Trough of Disillusionment' (Crypto in 2022). We aim to buy in the Trough and sell at the Peak.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Becoming Mr. Market. The danger is that you start to share his mood. When everyone is selling, you feel scared too. When everyone is buying, you feel greedy. To defeat Mr. Market, you must be stoic. You must have your own internal valuation model that is immune to his daily quotes.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Mr. Market is your servant, not your master."
