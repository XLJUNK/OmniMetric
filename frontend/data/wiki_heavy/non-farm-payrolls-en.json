        "summary": "Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) measures the number of added or lost jobs in the US economy, excluding farm workers and government employees. It is the 'King of Macro Data' because the Fed's dual mandate includes Maximum Employment. A strong NFP typically signals a strong economy but can trigger rate hike fears ('Good News is Bad News').",
        "deep_dive": "NFP comes from the Establishment Survey (businesses), which differs from the Household Survey (workers). In recent years, a massive divergence has emerged: NFP often shows job growth while the Household Survey shows stagnation, due to multiple job holders (gig economy) being double-counted in NFP but counted once in Household.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Migration flows are distorting the NFP. A surge in immigration increases labor supply, allowing NFP to beat expectations without triggering wage inflation. This 'Goldilocks Supply Shock' is key to understanding why the US economy hasn't crashed yet.\", \"macro\": \"The 'Birth/Death Model' is artificially padding NFP. This statistical adjustment assumes new business creation based on past trends, but in a high-rate environment, business failures are likely higher. NFP is likely overstating growth by 50k-100k jobs per month.\", \"quant\": \"I trade the revision cycle. Recently, initial NFP prints are strong, but are revised down significantly 1-2 months later. My strategy is to fade the initial 'pop' on a strong NFP print, expecting the 'whisper number' to be far lower once revisions hit.\", \"technical\": \"NFP days disrupt all technical patterns. The 'NFP Candle' often sets the high or low for the month. If NFP misses expectation by >1 Standard Deviation, it often triggers a multi-week trend reversal in USDJPY and Gold.\", \"policy\": \"The Fed knows the data is noisy. They are looking at the 3-month moving average. As long as the 3-month average stays above 150k, they won't cut rates aggressively. A drop below 100k is the panic threshold.\", \"tech\": \"Algorithmic Intelligence displacement is invisible in NFP so far because it's happening in 'hiring freezes' rather than layoffs. Companies aren't firing; they just aren't replacing departing humans, opting for Algorithmic Intelligence agents instead. This 'Silent Attrition' will eventually show up as a structural decline in NFP trend.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The risk is a 'Negative Print Shock' where NFP suddenly turns negative (job losses) due to a credit event, forcing immediate emergency rate cuts. The upside 'No Landing' risk is NFP staying >200k indefinitely due to re-industrialization and Algorithmic Intelligence capex boom.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Distrust the headline number. Always check the 'Household Survey' employment number and the 'Average Hourly Earnings' (Wage Inflation). If NFP is strong but Wages are weak, it's Bullish (Goldilocks). If both are strong, it's Bearish (Rates Higher)."
