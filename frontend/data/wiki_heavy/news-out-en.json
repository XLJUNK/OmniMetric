        "summary": "This maxim explains why markets often fall on good news and rise on bad news. Once the 'event' (earnings, election, policy change) actually happens, the uncertainty is removed, and the speculators who bought the anticipation exit their positions. This phenomenon is known in Japan as 'Zairyo Dezukushi' (Exhaustion of Materials).",
        "deep_dive": "Anticipation drives price. Realization kills volatility. The market discounts the future. If everyone expects a great earnings report, the stock rises *before* the report. When the report confirms the expectation, there are no new buyers left, only sellers taking profit.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Peace Treaties. The signing of a peace treaty often marks the top of the 'peace dividend' rally. The market rallied on the *rumor* of peace. Once the ink is dry, the geopolitical risk premium is gone, but so is the speculative fervor. Focus shifts to the hard work of reconstruction.\", \"macro\": \"Fed Rate Cuts. The market rallies for months in anticipation of the first rate cut. On the day the Fed actually cuts rates, the market often sells off (Sell the Fact). The liquidity support is real, but the *excitement* of the pivot is over.\", \"quant\": \"Event Arbitrage. Algos are programmed to trade the millisecond news hits the wire. If the news matches the consensus, they fade the move (mean reversion). The 'surprise factor' is the only thing that moves prices sustainably after the event.\", \"technical\": \"Gap Fills. A common pattern is the 'Gap and Crap'. A stock gaps up on good news at the open, then sells off all day to fill the gap. This is classic 'News Out' behavior. The smart money uses the liquidity of the news event to unload into the retail buyers.\", \"policy\": \"Election Results. Markets hate uncertainty. They are volatile *before* the election. Once the winner is declared (even if it's the candidate the market disliked), volatility collapses and a trend emerges. Certainty allows risk to be repriced.\", \"tech\": \"Product Launches. Apple stock famously drops on the day of the iPhone Keynote. The buildup of rumors drove the price up. The reality of the device (no matter how good) rarely lives up to the infinite imagination of the speculators.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The Surprise Factor. If the news is *significantly* better or worse than priced in, the move is NOT over. An 'Earnings Surprise' (beating estimates by 20%) can trigger a new trend. 'News Out' only applies when the news is within the expected range.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Do not bet on the news. Bet on how much of the news is already in the price. If the news is out, the easy money has already been made."
