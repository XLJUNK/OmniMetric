        "summary": "The 'Global Benchmark' rate. The 10-Year US Treasury yield is the most important interest rate in the world, serving as the basis for the cost of capital for everything from US mortgages to corporate bonds.",
        "deep_dive": "In 2026, the 10-Year yield is in a 'New Normal' regime of 4.0% to 5.0%. The era of zero-interest rate policy (ZIRP) is a distant memory. The yield reflects two competing forces: the health of the US economy (growth/inflation) and the massive fiscal deficit of the US government. When yields rise, they act as a 'Valuation Brake' on growth stocks and a 'Cost Burden' for the US debt. For macro traders, the 10-Year yield is the ultimate signal of 'Fiscal Dominance'. If the yield spikes while inflation is falling, it means the 'Bond Vigilantes' are protesting the government's spending levels. Conversely, if yields fall during a crisis, the 'Flight to Safety' is still intact.",

            "technical": "The 5.0% level is the generational ceiling; breaking above it would trigger a global re-pricing event.",
            "tech": "AI-driven liquidity in the Treasury market has reduced the 'Flash Crash' risk but intensified the speed of yield resets."
