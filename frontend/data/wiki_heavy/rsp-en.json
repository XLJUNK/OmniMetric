        "summary": "The 'True Market' indicator. Unlike the standard S&P 500, which is market-cap weighted, the Equal Weight index gives every stock the same influence.",
        "deep_dive": "In 2026, the RSP is the ultimate tool for detecting 'Market Fragility'. If the standard S&P 500 is making new highs while the RSP is flat, it means the rally is being driven by a tiny group of tech giants. This is called 'Poor Breadth'. When the RSP starts to outperform the standard index, it signals a 'Rotation' into the broader economy—banks, industrials, and energy. For macro traders, the RSP-to-SPY ratio is the scoreboard of the 'Concentration Risk' in the global financial system. A rising ratio is a sign of a healthy, sustainable bull market where the average company is thriving, not just the AI leaders.",

            "macro": "Reflects the 'Median Company' health rather than the 'Top 7' outliers.",
            "quant": "Mean-reversion quants use RSP to find valuation disconnects between the mega-caps and the rest of the market.",
            "technical": "Watch for the breakout of the RSP/SPY ratio; it signals a change in market leadership.",
            "policy": "Reflects the impact of interest rates on the 'Average' corporate debt profile.",
            "geopolitics": "Less sensitive to global tech export bans than the standard S&P 500.",
            "tech": "The 'Laggard' play. RSP is the bet that AI benefits will eventually trickle down to traditional legacy businesses."
