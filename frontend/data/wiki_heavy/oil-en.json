        "summary": "The 'Lifeblood' of the global economy. Crude oil is the primary energy source for transport and the raw input for the entire petrochemical industry.",
        "deep_dive": "In 2026, the oil market is defined by the 'Structural Underinvestment' of the previous decade. While the world is transitioning to green energy, the demand for oil continues to grow in Emerging Markets. This creates a 'Supply Fragility' where any drone strike or tanker disruption causes an immediate price spike. The oil market is currently a battle between 'OPEC+ Discipline' (led by Saudi and Russia) and 'US Shale Productivity'. For macro traders, oil is the 'Headline Inflation' engine. When oil rises above $100, it acts as a 'Global Tax' that slows down consumer spending and forces central banks to stay hawkish. It is the most politically sensitive asset on earth, and its price determines the trade balance of every nation on the planet.",

            "macro": "Every $10 increase in oil prices reduces global GDP growth by ~0.2% and increases CPI by ~0.3%.",
            "policy": "The 2026 US 'Strategic Petroleum Reserve' (SPR) policy is the primary price dampener. If the SPR is empty, the 'Volatility Ceiling' disappears.",
            "quant": "Quants trade the 'Oil-to-Dollar' correlation. Usually inverse, but in 2026 both are rising together due to the US becoming a dominant exporter.",
            "tech": "AI-driven drilling and fracking have pushed US production to record highs, but 'Depletion Rates' are accelerating in the Permian Basin.",
            "technical": "Watch the $70 floor and $120 ceiling. If oil breaks outside this range, it triggers a 'Regime Shift' in the global economy."
