        "summary": "The Nasdaq 100 tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq. It is the world's premier high-beta growth index and the home of 'Big Tech'.",
        "deep_dive": "If the S&P 500 is the engine of the economy, the Nasdaq 100 is the 'Future'. In 2026, the QQQ has transitioned from 'Cloud Growth' to 'General Artificial Intelligence' (GAI). It is comprised of the firms that own the 'Compute', the 'Data', and the 'Algorithms'. This makes it the most 'Capital Efficient' index in history, with margins that far exceed traditional industrials. However, the Nasdaq 100 is extremely sensitive to 'Real Rates'. Because its valuations are based on earnings far in the future, a rise in yields (TIPS) directly crashes its present value. In 2026, the index is navigating the 'AI-Monetization' phase. Investors are no longer just buying the chips; they are buying the software that eats the world. It is a highly 'Crowded' trade, meaning that when the trend reverses, the liquidation is violent and fast, often leading the broader market lower.",

            "tech": "The 'Compute Power' barometer. If NVIDIA, MSFT, and GOOG are spending, the Nasdaq 100 is in a bull market.",
            "macro": "The 'Duration Play'. Technology stocks act like long-dated bonds; they rally when the Fed hints at pausing and fall when yields reset higher.",
            "quant": "Driven by 'Volatility Targeting' funds. When QQQ volatility is low, these funds leverage up; when it spikes, they are forced to sell instantly.",
            "geopolitics": "The 'Great Firewall' and semiconductor chokepoints in Taiwan are the existential threats to the Nasdaq's supply chain stability.",
            "policy": "Antitrust regulation in the US and EU is the 'Sleeping Giant'. Breaking up the tech monopolies would structurally reduce the QQQ multiple by 20-30%.",
            "technical": "Extreme 'Overextension' relative to the weekly 50-SMA is the primary signal for an impending 10-15% 'Mean Reversion' correction."
