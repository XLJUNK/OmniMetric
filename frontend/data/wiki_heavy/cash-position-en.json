        "summary": "You do not always have to be in the market. Cash is not 'nothing'; it is an option on future asset prices. When the market is falling or uncertain, holding cash allows you to sleep well and deploy capital when the opportunities are ripe (at the bottom).",
        "deep_dive": "This counters the 'Inflation Fear-Mongering' that says you must always be invested. While inflation eats cash in the long run, in the short run (during a crash), cash outperforms stocks that are down 50%. Cash provides 'Optionality'.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Crisis Insurance. When geopolitical tensions are high (war, sanctions), markets become illiquid. Cash is the only asset with zero liquidity risk. In times of extreme crisis, cash is king until the dust settles.\", \"macro\": \"Dry Powder. The goal of macro investing is to buy 'Regime Shifts'. These shifts (e.g., 2008 Financial Crisis, 2020 COVID Crash) offer generational buying opportunities. You can only buy them if you have cash. If you are fully invested, you are a spectator.\", \"quant\": \"Sharpe Ratio Optimization. Moving to cash during high volatility periods reduces portfolio variance. A strategy that goes to cash during bear markets has a much higher risk-adjusted return than a 'Buy and Hold' strategy that rides the drawdown all the way down.\", \"technical\": \"No Trade Zone. Sometimes the chart is messy (choppy sideways action). The best trade is 'No Trade'. Being on the sidelines is a valid technical position. We wait for a breakout before deploying cash.\", \"policy\": \"Interest Rate Arbitrage. In a high-rate environment (like 5% interest), cash pays you to wait. You are getting a risk-free return while stocks are volatile. The 'Cost of Waiting' is negative. Cash is a competitive asset class.\", \"tech\": \"Venture Capital Model. VCs sit on piles of cash for years, waiting for the right startup. They don't fund every pitch. They wait for the 'Fat Pitch'. Public market investors should adopt this mindset. Patience is an edge.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Inflation Drag. Holding too much cash for too long (years) assures a loss of purchasing power. Cash is for tactical deployment, not strategic hibernation. You must eventually pull the trigger.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Cash gives you the freedom to say 'No' to bad trades. It is the ammunition for the next bull market."
