        "summary": "This old adage suggests selling stocks in May and returning in November. Historically, the summer months have lower volumes and returns. While not always true every year, it highlights the seasonality of markets and the danger of low-liquidity periods.",
        "deep_dive": "The 'Summer Doldrums' are real. Institutional traders go on vacation, volume dries up, and markets become choppy or stagnant. The period from November to April has historically produced the vast majority of stock market gains. It's about playing the statistical probabilities of seasonality.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Summer Wars. Wars often start or escalate in summer (better weather for campaigns). Low liquidity + Geopolitical shock = Crash. August is historically a dangerous month for geopolitical black swans (e.g., WWI started in July/Aug).\", \"macro\": \"Liquidity Cycles. Tax payments in April drain liquidity. Summer vacations reduce velocity of money. The 'Halloween Indicator' (buying in Nov) aligns with corporate buyback blackout periods ending and holiday spending starting.\", \"quant\": \"Statistical Validity. The data supports this phenomenon over 100 years, but the 'alpha' has decayed in recent decades as algorithms don't take vacations. It works better in Europe than in the US. It is a filter, not a hard rule.\", \"technical\": \"Volume Drop. We see a measurable drop in volume starting in late May. Low volume means higher volatility and more 'noise'. Breakouts in summer are more likely to fail (fakeouts). We reduce position size in low volume regimes.\", \"policy\": \"Recess Risk. Parliaments and Congress often go on recess in August. This reduces the chance of pro-market legislation passing but increases the risk of unmanaged crises. Policy vacuums are dangerous.\", \"tech\": \"Product Cycle. Tech companies launch products in Q4 (Holiday season) or Q1/Q2. Summer is often a news vacuum. No news is bad news for high-growth momentum stocks that need constant catalysts to sustain high valuations.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "FOMO Risk. If a major bull run starts in June (like 2020 or 2023), you miss out. Markets can remain irrational during the summer. Being out of the market entirely has a high opportunity cost.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Don't blindly sell in May, but definitely manage your expectations and size. Summer is for swimming, not for aggressive trading."
