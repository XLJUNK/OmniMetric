        "deep_dive": "In 2026, India is the 'New Factory of the World'. As global firms 'China+1' their supply chains, USD/INR has become the most important FX pair in the Emerging Market basket. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) manages this pair with extreme precision, maintaining a 'Crawling Peg' to prevent excessive volatility that would scare off foreign investment. India's massive services exports and growing manufacturing base provide a structural demand for the Rupee, but its dependence on imported oil makes USD/INR hyper-sensitive to energy prices. For macro traders, USD/INR is the 'Stability Play'—it reflects the transformation of India into a core global industrial hub.",
