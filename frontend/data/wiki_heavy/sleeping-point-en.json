        "summary": "If your investments are keeping you awake at night, your position size is too large. This maxim emphasizes that mental health and clear thinking are more important than potential profits. You make bad decisions when you are stressed and sleep-deprived.",
        "deep_dive": "This is a risk management rule disguised as lifestyle advice. If you are checking the markets at 3 AM, you are over-leveraged or over-exposed. The 'Sleeping Point' is the maximum position size you can hold while maintaining emotional equilibrium.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Political Stability. In unstable regimes, the 'Sleeping Point' is zero. If you are worried the government will seize your assets tomorrow, you cannot invest rationally. We only allocate capital to jurisdictions where we can sleep at night.\", \"macro\": \"Volatility Targeting. We adjust position size based on volatility (VIX). If VIX is 15 (calm), we might hold $1M. If VIX is 30 (panic), we cut that to $500k to maintain the same risk budget. High volatility means smaller size.\", \"quant\": \"Kelly Criterion Adjustment. The Kelly Criterion tells you optimal bet size for max growth, but it often suggests bets that are too volatile for human psychology (Half-Kelly is preferred). The 'Sleeping Point' is basically 'Quarter-Kelly'. It sacrifices some theoretical growth for survival.\", \"technical\": \"Overnight Risk. The market can gap down 10% overnight due to news. If you can't afford that gap, you are too big. We close day trades before the bell to eliminate overnight risk. We sleep cash.\", \"policy\": \"Regulatory Uncertainty. If a company is in the crosshairs of regulators (e.g., Antitrust suit), the stock becomes binary (Win/Loss). Holding a large position in a binary outcome is gambling, not investing. Reduce size to a lottery ticket position.\", \"tech\": \"Server Uptime. For crypto traders, 'Sleeping Point' is literal. If your DeFi protocol might get hacked while you sleep, you are overexposed. We only use battle-tested contracts and platforms. Security audits are our sleeping pills.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Under-allocation. The risk is that you are so risk-averse you hold too little risk to meaningfuly grow wealth. If you sleep *too* well, you might be losing to inflation. You need some 'Good Stress' (Eustress) to perform.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Money is a tool for freedom, not a source of anxiety. If your money owns you, you have already lost."
