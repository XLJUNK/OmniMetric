        "deep_dive": "In 2026, High Yield spreads are the primary indicator for the 'Corporate Credit Cycle'. As companies face a 'Refinancing Wall', the stability of these spreads determines if the economy has a 'Soft Landing' or a 'Hard Landing'. Narrow spreads (under 300bps) signal a 'Search for Yield' and extreme complacency. Widening spreads (over 600bps) indicate that the 'Financial Plumbing' is clogging and companies are beginning to fail. For institutional investors, this is the 'Front Line' of risk; when spreads widen, equities always follow. It is the purest measure of 'Economic Survival' for the leveraged corporate world.",
