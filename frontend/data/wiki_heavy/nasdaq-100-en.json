        "summary": "The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. It is the definitive barometer for global technology and innovation-driven growth.",
        "deep_dive": "In 2026, the Nasdaq 100 is no longer just a collection of software companies; it has matured into an Algorithmic Intelligence infrastructure index. With companies dominating everything from chip design to hyperscale cloud services, the index reflects the global economy's ability to monetize artificial intelligence.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"The Nasdaq 100 is the West's digital arsenal. The dominance of these firms in semiconductors and cloud computing is a pillar of national security and global competitive advantage.\", \"macro\": \"It is the sector most sensitive to real interest rates. In a 'higher for longer' environment, the Nasdaq's resilience comes from its massive cash flows and market dominance.\", \"quant\": \"We measure the concentration of the 'Magnificent 7' to assess market risk. Dispersion in the Nasdaq 100 in 2026 indicates whether Algorithmic Intelligence is benefiting the whole economy or just infra providers.\", \"technical\": \"The Nasdaq typically leads the market both up and down. Its correlation with liquidity conditions (M2) is extreme. A close above key moving averages usually attracts momentum flows.\", \"policy\": \"Antitrust regulation and Algorithmic Intelligence ethics are the biggest regulatory risks. In 2026, the balance between fostering innovation and preventing digital monopoly is the central theme in Washington and Brussels.\", \"tech\": \"The convergence of Algorithmic Intelligence, quantum computing, and robotics is manifest here. The Nasdaq 100 is the living laboratory of the next industrial revolution.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Overvaluation risks and 'capex fatigue' in Algorithmic Intelligence spending. Real rate sensitivity remains the primary macro risk factor.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Neutral to Bullish. The Nasdaq 100 remains the centerpiece of the 'Growth' category in the GMS model."
