        "summary": "This maxim describes the power of Beta (market correlation). When the general market is in a powerful bull run (rising tide), even mediocre companies (leaky boats) go up. Conversely, when the tide goes out (bear market), even good companies fall. Don't confuse 'brains' with a 'bull market'.",
        "deep_dive": "Academic studies show that 70-80% of a stock's movement is determined by the general market and its sector sector, not the individual company. You can pick the best stock in the world, but if the market crashes, it will fall. Respect the trend. Do not swim against the tide.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Global Tide. Geopolitics is the ultimate tide. During the 'Pax Americana' (rising tide), global trade flourished, and emerging markets rose. If we enter a period of 'De-globalization' (receding tide), everyone struggles. You cannot trade in a vacuum.\", \"macro\": \"Liquidity Tide. The 'tide' is literally central bank liquidity. When the Fed prints money (Quantitative Easing), asset prices rise. When they withdraw liquidity (Quantitative Tightening), asset prices fall. 'Don't fight the Fed' is another way of saying 'Don't fight the tide'.\", \"quant\": \"Beta Exposure. We measure 'Beta' to quantify the tide. A beta of 1.5 means the stock moves 1.5x the market. In a rising tide, we want High Beta. In a falling tide, we want Low Beta or Negative Beta (shorts). Managing Beta is more important than picking Alpha.\", \"technical\": \"Breadth Indicators. We use breadth (Advance-Decline Line) to measure the strength of the tide. If the market index is rising but fewer stocks are participating (divergence), the tide is turning. A healthy tide lifts *all* boats, not just a few generals.\", \"policy\": \"Fiscal Stimulus. Government spending is a fiscal tide. When the government injects trillions into the economy (e.g., COVID stimulus), it lifts all sectors. When austerity hits, it lowers the water level for everyone.\", \"tech\": \"Platform Waves. A major platform shift (Mainframe -> PC -> Mobile -> AI) is a technological tide. It lifts every company that attaches itself to the new wave. Nvidia is rising because it is surfing the AI tide, not just because of its own chip design.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Naked Swimming. As Warren Buffett said, \"Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked.\" The tide masks problems. When money is easy, zombie companies survive. When the tide recedes, bankruptcies explode. Be careful what you hold when the water level drops.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Respect Beta. It is bigger than you, and it is bigger than the stock."
