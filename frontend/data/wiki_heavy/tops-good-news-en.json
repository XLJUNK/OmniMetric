        "summary": "This maxim explains the seemingly paradoxical behavior of markets. Markets top out when the news is best because all the good news is already priced in. Markets bottom out when the news is worst because all the sellers have already sold.",
        "deep_dive": "The market is a discounting mechanism. It looks 6-12 months into the future. By the time the 'good news' hits the headlines (e.g., record earnings), the smart money has already bought. They use the liquidity of the good news to sell to the latecomers.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Victory Declarations. When a leader declares 'Mission Accomplished' (Top), it is often the peak of political capital and the beginning of the decline. When a nation is in despair and defeat seems certain (Bottom), it is often the catalyst for necessary reform and rebirth.\", \"macro\": \"Employment Peaks. The lowest unemployment rate often marks the top of the economic cycle. Why? because it can't get any better. It can only get worse. The highest unemployment marks the bottom. We sell full employment.\", \"quant\": \"News Sentiment. We measure the sentiment of news headlines. When sentiment is +2 standard deviations above the mean (euphoria), we short. When it is -2 standard deviations (despair), we go long. The news is a lagging indicator of price.\", \"technical\": \"Divergence. At a market top, the news is good, but the price stops going up (divergence). This means buying pressure is exhausted. At a bottom, the news is bad, but the price stops going down. This means selling pressure is exhausted.\", \"policy\": \"Policy Pivot points. Central banks hike rates when the economy is hot (Good News/Top) and cut rates when the economy is cold (Bad News/Bottom). The 'Bad News' triggers the 'Good Policy' (stimulus) that saves the market.\", \"tech\": \"Product Launches. The stock often rallies into a major product launch (Buy the Rumor) and dumps on the actual launch day (Sell the Fact), even if the product is great. The 'Good News' was the anticipation, not the reality.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "Trend Extension. Sometimes good news is the start of a *new* trend, not the end of an old one. This happens during paradigm shifts (e.g., Internet in 1995). You must distinguish between 'cyclical good news' (Top) and 'secular good news' (Breakout).",
        "gms_conclusion": "If it's in the newspaper, it's in the price. Trade the *reaction* to the news, not the news itself."
