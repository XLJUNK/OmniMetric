        "summary": "The Copper/Gold Ratio compares the price of Copper (an industrial metal essential for growth) to the price of Gold (a safe-haven asset). It is a powerful barometer for global economic health and risk appetite.",
        "deep_dive": "Copper is 'Dr. Copper', diagnosing the health of the physical economy (construction, tech, grid). Gold is fear. When the ratio rises, growth is outperforming fear (Rates UP). When it falls, fear is outperforming growth (Rates DOWN).",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Historically, Gold rallies during war. Copper rallies during peace/trade booms. A collapsing ratio often precedes geopolitical instability or recession.\", \"macro\": \"This is the single best leading indicator for the 10-Year Treasury Yield. The two charts overlay almost perfectly. If the Ratio falls but Yields stay high, Yields will eventually crash to catch up.\", \"quant\": \"Our models show a 90% correlation with the PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index). It captures the 'Reflation vs. Deflation' debate better than the stock market does.\", \"technical\": \"We watch for 'Double Tops' in this ratio. It topped out before the 2008 crash and the 2000 bust. It acts as an early warning system for equities.\", \"policy\": \"Central Bank Gold buying (de-dollarization) distorts the denominator (Gold), potentially suppressing the ratio artificially. We adjust for 'Central Bank Net Purchases' to get a cleaner economic signal.\", \"tech\": \"The AI boom requires massive copper for data centers and power grids. This could create a 'Secular Bull Market' in the numerator (Copper), breaking the traditional correlation with yields. We might see the Ratio rise even as growth slows, due to physical scarcity.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "The risk to the signal is 'Stagflation'. If Gold rises due to inflation fear, and Copper rises due to supply shocks, the ratio might move sideways while the economy crumbles.",
        "gms_conclusion": "Watch this ratio to predict Interest Rates. If Copper/Gold is diving, do not bet on higher yields. The Bond Vigilantes follow this ratio religiously."
