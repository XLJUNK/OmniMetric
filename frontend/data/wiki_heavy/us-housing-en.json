        "deep_dive": "In 2026, the US Housing market is characterized by 'The Big Freeze'. While mortgage rates have normalized at 6-7%, home prices remain at record highs due to a 4-million-unit shortage. This has created a 'Haves and Have-nots' economy. Those with 3% mortgages from 2021 are 'Locked-in', while new buyers are priced out. This lack of inventory prevents a price crash but also stops the 'Economic Velocity' that housing usually provides. For macro traders, housing is the primary driver of 'Core Inflation' via the OER (Owners Equivalent Rent). If housing stays hot, the Fed cannot cut rates. It is the most important political and economic variable in the US domestic landscape.",
