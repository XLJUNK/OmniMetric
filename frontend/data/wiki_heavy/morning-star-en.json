        "summary": "The 'Morning Star' (Sankawa Ake no Myojou) is a classic three-candle bullish reversal pattern from Sakata's Five Methods. It appears at the bottom of a downtrend. First candle: Long black (selling). Second candle: Small body or Doji (indecision) that gaps down. Third candle: Long white (buying) that penetrates deep into the first candle. It signals the dawn of a new trend.",
        "deep_dive": "The Morning Star is a story of psychology. 1. Bears are in control (Long Red). 2. Bears try to push lower but fail; uncertainty enters (The Star). 3. Bulls seize control and entrap the bears (Long Green). The gap (window) is crucial.",
        "council_debate": "{\"geopolitics\": \"Regime Change. The 'Morning Star' of geopolitics is when a dictator falls (Long Red), a transitional council forms (The Star/Indecision), and then a democratic election is held (Long Green). We invest in the reconstruction phase.\", \"macro\": \"Inflation Peak. 1. Inflation is rampant (Long Red bond market). 2. Inflation data flattens; Fed pause tones appear (The Star). 3. Inflation prints lower; Fed signals cuts (Long Green). We buy bonds at the star.\", \"quant\": \"Pattern Recognition. Our ML models scan for the Morning Star geometry. We look for specific parameters: the gap size, the star's volatility (should be low), and the thrust of the third candle (>50% of first candle). Win rates increase when combined with RSI divergence.\", \"technical\": \"Volume Confirmation. A true Morning Star must have volume confirmation. The Star should have lower volume (drying up selling pressure). The Third Candle should have explosive volume (new buying interest). Without volume, it's just noise.\", \"policy\": \"Fiscal Stimulus. 1. Economy crashes (Red). 2. Policymakers debate (Star). 3. Massive stimulus package passed (Green). We buy on the passing of the bill.\", \"tech\": \"Gartner Hype Cycle. 1. Trough of Disillusionment (Red). 2. Slope of Enlightenment starts (Star). 3. Plateau of Productivity (Green). The Morning Star is ideal for entering post-crash tech stocks that have survived the winter.\"}",
        "forecast_risks": "False Dawn. The risk is that the third candle fails to hold. If price drops below the low of the Star, the pattern is invalidated and the downtrend resumes. This is a powerful sell signal (continuation).",
        "gms_conclusion": "The darkest hour is just before the dawn. The Morning Star is the first ray of light. Trust it, but verify with volume."
